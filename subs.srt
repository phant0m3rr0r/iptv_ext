00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,430
This week's story on Rainbow Club.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,580
You have a guest.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,570
The Rainbow Club members have an unexpected guest.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,170
Preparing to move to a new house, I have no place to go.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,840
So I stay at Kian84's house.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,630
We have a Tekken match and go to a karaoke.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,410
(Hyun Moo is immersed in the song.)

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,730
Tough girls gather.

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,350
They enjoy all kinds of food together...

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,110
and talk about guys. How would they spend a day together?

11
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,790
Pose like this or face forward.

12
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:34,970
- Try something else like this.
 -  That's...

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,030
Here's another tough girl.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,300
Dreaming of becoming like Angelina Jolie,

15
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,130
she learns stunt skills.

16
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,880
Push. That's good.

17
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,680
Where am I?

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,800
"What is your name?"

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,110
The legendary singer, Yang Hee Eun visits Kim Ban Jang's house.

20
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,500
Ban Jang is nervous all day.

21
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,170
He's afraid of being scolded by his senior singer.

22
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,630
Kim Ban Jang.

23
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,400
(He is startled.)

24
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,300
I Live Alone, "Welcome to My House".

25
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,830
Welcome to my house

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,570
(It's a hot day in August at Hyun Moo's house.)

27
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,830
(The alarm wakes him up.)

28
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,800
(He's tossing on his bed.)

29
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,170
(Gosh, I'm tired.)

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,230
(It's 7:30am.)

31
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,700
(I have to get up now.)

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,600
(He looks very tired.)

33
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,400
I should start packing.

34
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,830
(What are you rushing for?)

35
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:39,800
Today, my lease expires, so I have to move out.

36
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:44,130
However, I can't move in to my new house today.

37
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,430
I have to wait for 15 days.

38
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,070
So I had to find a place to stay.

39
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,030
I remembered Kian84 told me that I could stay at his house.

40
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,300
(This is when he invited Kian84 and Ban Jang to his house.)

41
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,170
My move-in date is on 25th, but I have to move out on the 10th.

42
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,270
- I have to wait for 15 days.
 -  What will you do?

43
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,470
Come to my house. You can stay with me.

44
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,570
Can I?

45
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,470
I have a queen size bed. We can sleep together.

46
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,730
- In that room?
 -  Let's sleep together.

47
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,280
In the room with a scary painting?

48
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,000
We always help each other out.

49
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,700
We're the icon of mutual help.

50
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,930
I decided to stay at his house for a while.

51
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,300
How many days am I going to stay at his house?

52
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,530
(Hyun Moo packs his clothes to wear for 15 days.)

53
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,370
It feels surreal.

54
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,400
Shorts.

55
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,930
(He packs a T-shirt and a pair of shorts.)

56
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,260
(That would be enough.)

57
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,830
He probably doesn't have much food there. Goodness.

58
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,470
(He goes to the kitchen to pack food.)

59
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,200
(What's in my fridge?)

60
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,730
I have nothing to pack.

61
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,130
(What food is he taking out from his fridge?)

62
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,370
(It's frozen food.)

63
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,400
Dumplings.

64
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,770
I should give him some alcohol drinks.

65
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,600
Here it is.

66
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,070
(It's a perfect gift for the person who loves drinking.)

67
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,300
Let's give him an expensive one. It's champagne.

68
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,370
(Next, he searches the cupboard.)

69
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,900
(I have canned tuna, instant rice and ramyeon.)

70
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,970
(This would be enough for a while.)

71
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,630
(He packed only a pair of clothes,)

72
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,900
(but he's packing a lot of food.)

73
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,900
I think I'm done.

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,770
(He's ready to stay with Kian84.)

75
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,730
I should call him.

76
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,200
Is he sleeping?

77
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,030
Hello?

78
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,220
- Hi, Kian84.
 -  Hi, Hyun Moo.

79
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,280
You know I'm going to your house in the evening, right?

80
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,070
Sure. Come over and hang out.

81
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,300
I'm not going there to hang out. I'll stay there for a few days.

82
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,020
For how long?

83
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,070
- For 15 days.
 -  For 15 days?

84
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,070
For 15 days. Okay.

85
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,530
Hold on.

86
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,230
Have you bought an air conditioner?

87
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,230
- I bought one yesterday.
 -  Okay.

88
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,670
- I'll go to your house after work.
 -  Okay.

89
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,800
- See you soon.
 -  See you.

90
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,670
They're here.

91
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,630
(The movers arrived.)

92
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,200
- Hello.
 -  Hello.

93
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,500
Hello. Please come in.

94
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,770
- Hello.
 -  Hello.

95
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,300
Wow, you arrived at exactly 8am.

96
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,330
Do I have a lot to pack?

97
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,540
I think it'll be about six tonnes.

98
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,170
Usually, a four-member family has this much.

99
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,270
- It's a lot for a single man.
 -  Is it?

100
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,600
- I have less stuff than last time.
 -  That's right.

101
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,570
- I don't see your dining table.
 -  I gave some out.

102
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,900
Would you charge me less then?

103
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,970
- That doesn't make any difference.
 -  Is that so?

104
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,800
Please tell us if you have any valuables or fragile items.

105
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,970
Valuables?

106
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,870
You should carry those with you.

107
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,200
- My pictures.
 -  Okay.

108
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,300
- Please take good care of them.
 -  I understand.

109
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,030
- Especially that one.
 -  Okay.

110
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,100
(Please take good care of me.)

111
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,200
- Just be careful not to break them.
 -  Okay.

112
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,390
Excuse me. We can't pack what's in here.

113
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,730
- Do you mean the food?
 -  Yes.

114
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,630
I see.

115
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,300
I didn't expect the food would be a problem.

116
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,300
What should I do with these peaches?

117
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,100
(He takes out the peaches.)

118
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,870
I should give them to Kian84.

119
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,830
I'm sure he doesn't have any fruit.

120
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,670
I'll pack the food in that tiny bag.

121
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,530
- Is there anything to eat in here?
 -  Yes.

122
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,160
- Like frozen sagol?
 -  Yes.

123
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,800
I'll eat this for dinner tonight.

124
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,370
(While Hyun Moo is packing food in the kitchen,)

125
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,340
(the mover puts Wilson in a box.)

126
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,800
(Pressing)

127
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,300
(I'm not to be packed in here.)

128
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,370
(Since we found you, we have to pack you.)

129
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,570
(The movers move everything out of the house quickly.)

130
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,530
(He's waiting outside to let them work freely.)

131
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,100
Where is Wilson?

132
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,300
(He realises that Wilson is gone.)

133
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,800
I think they packed Wilson.

134
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,670
- Excuse me.
 -  Yes?

135
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,930
- There was a stuffed bear.
 -  I saw it. A white bear.

136
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,470
- That's right.
 -  It's...

137
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,370
packed with couch cushions.

138
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,700
- Is it in the box with cushions?
 -  Yes.

139
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,570
- Do you need to find it?
 -  No.

140
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,500
- You don't have to.
 -  I'll find it for you.

141
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,600
That's okay.

142
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,800
- Do you know where it is?
 -  Yes.

143
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,570
(He feels apologetic to both the mover and Wilson.)

144
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,730
I should've put Wilson aside.

145
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,630
(Wilson, wait. I'm coming.)

146
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,400
(Fortunately, the mover found the box quickly.)

147
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,740
I think this is it.

148
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,100
- Is that it?
 -  Yes.

149
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,000
I see the fur.

150
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,800
(Finally, the box is opened.)

151
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,870
Oh, my.

152
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,130
- Thank you.
 -  You're welcome.

153
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,300
- I'll carry this.
 -  Okay.

154
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,200
(He's caressing Wilson.)

155
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,470
You must've been scared.

156
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,700
He's scared. He's crying.

157
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,800
I'm sorry.

158
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,030
(Please take good care of me from now on.)

159
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,700
(He's holding Wilson tightly.)

160
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,600
(The movers are done packing.)

161
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,570
- I'll see you on 26th.
 -  Okay.

162
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,130
- Thank you.
 -  You're welcome.

163
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,200
Goodbye. See you in 15 days.

164
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,800
(He's back to his empty house.)

165
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,930
The house looks like a model home now.

166
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,830
(There's nothing left to show that he lived here for two years.)

167
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,500
Two years ago, I was sitting right here...

168
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,200
thinking how I should decorate the house.

169
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,470
I'm exhausted.

170
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,330
(Two years ago, he imagined how his new house would look.)

171
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,870
(However, the reality was different from what he imagined.)

172
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,300
I'll keep my new house neat and tidy.

173
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,470
It's an important place.

174
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,460
In this house, I did a lot of thinking, rest and fun.

175
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,920
It's been a place to regain energy.

176
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,310
Things went well while I was living here as well.

177
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,430
It helped me move forward.

178
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,070
I'm grateful to this house.

179
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,080
Let's go, Wilson. I have to go to work now.

180
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,200
We'll go to a weird place later. Don't be surprised.

181
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,630
(He puts Wilson on his suitcase.)

182
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,100
(It's uncomfortable.)

183
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,530
(The suitcase falls.)

184
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,130
I should've just left you in the box.

185
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,500
(That's mean.)

186
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,730
Hang in there.

187
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,270
Goodbye.

188
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,930
(Goodbye, my old sweet home.)

189
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,800
(In the late afternoon, the sun is scorching.)

190
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,670
(Under the sun, there's Kian84's house.)

191
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,500
(Hyun Moo arrives after work.)

192
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,200
Kian84! Kian84!

193
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,830
Oh. Hi, Hyun Moo.

194
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,600
I'll go out.

195
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,730
- How did you come here?
 -  By car.

196
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,500
- Did you?
 -  Yes.

197
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,600
Please carry the peaches.

198
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,820
- What?
 -  Thank you for this.

199
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,800
You don't look happy with my gift.

200
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,470
- I'm afraid I might be criticised.
 -  You can be happy.

201
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,870
- Why would you be criticised?
 -  I was criticised for taking gifts.

202
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,770
You need to be strong. Don't let criticisms get you down.

203
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,000
- How...
 -  Let's enjoy the peaches.

204
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,630
(They rush in to avoid the heat.)

205
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,270
- You have more furniture. What?
 -  The air conditioner...

206
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,040
It's not yet set up.

207
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,500
(Hyun Moo's hope is sealed up.)

208
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,930
(I'm sorry.)

209
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,830
You haven't even opened the boxes?

210
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,150
It's funny how people's feelings change.

211
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,170
Once I saw the boxes of the air conditioner,

212
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,000
I thought of my other three friends.

213
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,500
"Should I call him?"

214
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,270
I told myself to sneak out of his house when he was asleep...

215
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,470
after having a good day with him.

216
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,070
I had so much going on in my head at that moment.

217
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,570
Since a lot of people buy an air conditioner in this season,

218
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,400
- I have to wait 10 days.
 -  It's a busy season?

219
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:33,470
I expected a cool breeze in your house.

220
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,040
I have a fan, though.

221
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,700
That's just noisy.

222
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,300
I'll put it on full blast.

223
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,070
Is this a heater?

224
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,070
No, it's a fan.

225
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,600
It will be cooler soon.

226
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,610
The movers took my stuff out of my house this morning.

227
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,130
All I have now is my suitcase.

228
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,990
How many days will you stay here?

229
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,410
For about 10 days.

230
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,630
Will you really stay for 10 days?

231
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:59,100
I need your permission. I can't stay just because I want to.

232
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,730
(For 10 days?)

233
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,900
- You don't look...
 -  It'd be an honour for me.

234
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,120
You don't look so happy about it.

235
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,820
I'm happy. It'd be an honour for me.

236
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,370
You look very different from when I gave you my furniture.

237
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,040
- You said you didn't use the table.
 -  That one?

238
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,400
That's true. I rarely use it.

239
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,860
- I can do everything on this table.
 -  You can eat and work here.

240
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,730
- Okay. I'll give it to you.
 -  Thank you.

241
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,410
- You can have it.
 -  Thank you.

242
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,380
Congratulations.

243
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,090
Thank you so much.

244
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,800
I got criticised for taking that table.

245
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,700
(He was criticised for receiving the table.)

246
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,300
I brought it because you said you weren't using it.

247
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,730
- Why do you care what they think?
 -  I read a lot of harsh comments.

248
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,430
- Someone called me a beggar.
 -  What did they say?

249
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,430
Pardon?

250
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,730
"Why does he keep asking to give him things?"

251
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:40,350
"Why would he try to take all those when he's making a lot of money?"

252
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,410
- Did you read all the comments?
 -  I read a few. I stopped reading...

253
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,870
- because it hurt my feelings.
 -  I see.

254
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,390
- They called me a beggar.
 -  No way.

255
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,570
Don't let it bother you. Being a celebrity isn't easy.

256
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,800
What?

257
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,380
- This is just the beginning.
 -  What are you talking about?

258
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,070
When people criticise my webtoon characters,

259
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,630
it feels like I'm hiding behind the characters.

260
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,780
I understand.

261
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,460
But this time, they criticised me.

262
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,500
Are you hurt?

263
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,750
- Because you took the table,
 -  Yes.

264
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,860
it took less time to move out today.

265
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,870
- Are you sure you'll be okay?
 -  I forgot.

266
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,030
I should put the food in the refrigerator.

267
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,870
My fridge is too small for all of them.

268
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,030
I brought frozen dumplings. I haven't even opened them.

269
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,070
- Is that so?
 -  Yes.

270
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,130
- Let's put them in the fridge...
 -  Let's share the food.

271
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,170
- and share it.
 -  Okay.

272
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,170
Do you know what this is? This is awesome.

273
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,280
Isn't it sagol?

274
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,230
My friend who runs a barbecue restaurant...

275
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,870
froze this for me.

276
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,400
- It's frozen?
 -  Let's eat it together.

277
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,300
(Let's eat sagol for dinner.)

278
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,600
I should put the sagol out...

279
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,790
if we're going to eat it tonight.

280
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,000
It takes an hour to defrost it.

281
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,870
Let's put this...

282
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,170
(He puts it on the table to defrost it.)

283
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,840
- It's good for your health.
 -  Thank you.

284
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,380
Please don't mention it.

285
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,230
I should be thanking you for letting me stay here.

286
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,300
- But...
 -  It must be hot in my house.

287
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,610
I didn't know it'd be this hot.

288
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,770
I slept in a motel the other day because it was too hot.

289
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,410
Is there a motel near here?

290
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,660
Yes, there is. Shall we go to a motel?

291
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,230
Don't be surprised if I disappear at night.

292
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,300
Let's sleep in a motel together.

293
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,770
Shall we? Would you like to do that?

294
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,660
- Shall we do that?
 -  Pardon?

295
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,290
- What do you say?
 -  I'd love to. It's cool there.

296
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,730
Let's sleep here...

297
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,630
and go to a motel if we can't stand the heat.

298
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,760
We should.

299
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,960
You went to a motel to avoid the heat?

300
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,290
I'm sorry, but can I borrow your clothes?

301
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,280
- Sure, I'll find...
 -  Can I?

302
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,430
Shall I find you something comfortable?

303
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,700
- We are the same size.
 -  You can wear these.

304
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,240
- Did you wash them?
 -  Yes, I did.

305
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,300
It's so hot.

306
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,470
(He washed them a long time ago.)

307
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,940
Change into comfortable clothes.

308
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,030
It's even hotter in here.

309
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,300
I don't sleep in that room because it's too hot.

310
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,600
Are these your bathing suit?

311
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,500
I wear those pants whenever I work near the deadline.

312
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,400
You don't need to wear underwear since it has inner pants.

313
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,370
We're not close enough to share underwear yet.

314
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,300
(They're too short for him.)

315
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,700
(They look like twins.)

316
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,000
Would you like to drink something?

317
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,730
I feel like I'm in a lookout shed.

318
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,570
I can't stand it. It's too hot.

319
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,600
It feels like...

320
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,400
It reminds me of the military training camp.

321
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,630
- You brought that?
 -  Yes.

322
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,610
(He's holding the bag of sagol.)

323
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,930
- Are you feeling better?
 -  It's so cool.

324
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,300
(It's cool.)

325
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,170
You can stay for 10 days.

326
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,390
- Are you sure you'll be okay?
 -  I snore.

327
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,710
- Do you?
 -  Yes.

328
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,970
I can just sleep in the office.

329
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,770
- Since you're staying here...
 -  I can't let you do that.

330
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,870
- Let's sleep here together.
 -  You want to get good comments?

331
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,870
It's not that.

332
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,670
If you sleep in your office and I sleep in your house,

333
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,030
You keep giving me presents.

334
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,290
Both of us were criticised once.

335
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,900
I was criticised about the drawing.

336
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,370
(Kian84 drew a portrait of him.)

337
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,570
This is amazing.

338
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,060
(He sold the drawing with a good intention.)

339
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,200
It's a meaningful event.

340
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,630
(How could he sell a gift just because he doesn't like it?)

341
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,830
Don't you think it's a nice drawing?

342
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,600
I was criticised because of your drawing.

343
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,630
You were criticised because of my table.

344
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:39,230
I was surprised how people criticised me like that.

345
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,830
- Don't worry about it.
 -  Okay.

346
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,810
- Then...
 -  Yes?

347
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,600
Until the sagol is defrosted,

348
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,470
- can I take a shower?
 -  Sure. Go ahead.

349
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,500
(Of course.)

350
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,130
(He chose to take a shower as the last resort.)

351
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,470
(The heat won't go away.)

352
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,100
(It's so hot.)

353
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,970
(It's extremely hot.)

354
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,370
(I can't stand it any more.)

355
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,430
(He puts the bag of sagol on his belly.)

356
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,170
I'm feeling so hot.

357
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:17,600
(He drinks soda to cool his throat.)

358
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,590
(After he finishes the soda,)

359
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,400
(he throws the bottle away.)

360
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,270
I'm starting to feel cool.

361
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:30,170
(The frozen sagol starts to cool his body down.)

362
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,770
(Wriggling)

363
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,600
(He puts the bag on his back.)

364
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
(Oh, yes.)

365
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,730
(What's he doing?)

366
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,810
That's good. That's a good idea.

367
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,110
Did you take a shower?

368
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,300
Yes, I did. It's hot.

369
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,870
(I'm still feeling hot even after a shower.)

370
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,570
Get some cool breeze.

371
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,000
- It doesn't make a big difference.
 -  I'll turn the fan.

372
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,010
Thank you.

373
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,130
That's too strong.

374
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
(He feels tired.)

375
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,830
(The fan is of no help at all.)

376
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,300
- This is too much.
 -  What a shame.

377
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,290
I bought an air conditioner to make you feel at home.

378
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,730
Will it be set up while I'm staying here?

379
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,300
I'll do my best to make that happen.

380
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,800
I'm sure that orders are really backed up.

381
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,770
So many people buy an air conditioner.

382
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,630
I'm hungry, though.

383
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,730
Gosh.

384
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,570
Let's heat up the sagol.

385
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,370
- Let's go.
 -  Okay.

386
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,770
I'm hungry.

387
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,740
It feels like I'm in my house.

388
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,030
My table is here.

389
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,900
I'm glad you have a dining table now.

390
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,300
Me, too. It's good to have a guest.

391
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,130
He tied this so tightly.

392
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,470
Do you have scissors?

393
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,730
I'll heat up the instant rice.

394
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,690
- Okay.
 -  I'll heat it up.

395
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:55,870
- I'll heat up the sagol.
 -  Okay.

396
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,770
If I hadn't moved out, I wouldn't have remembered this.

397
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,170
(He's cutting the bag with a knife.)

398
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,570
I can't believe I'm doing this.

399
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,470
What am I doing?

400
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,170
- Hold on.
 -  It works.

401
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,370
It looks like I'm cutting a watermelon.

402
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,870
It's like shaved ice made with sagol soup.

403
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,130
Who's calling you? Is it a girl?

404
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,170
Hello?

405
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,900
Oh, hello.

406
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,430
(To whom is he talking so nicely?)

407
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,000
You can set it up now?

408
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,260
Really?

409
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,870
They'll set up the air conditioner now?

410
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,030
- We don't have to go to a motel?
 -  That's right.

411
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,270
Thank you.

412
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,370
- He's coming.
 -  At this hour?

413
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,550
Yes, he said he's coming.

414
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,530
That's really nice of him.

415
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:40,970
This is for you.

416
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,900
Can I just eat it as it is?

417
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,600
I think we can warm it in the microwave.

418
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,130
- Are you going to put it in there?
 -  Let's boil it in here.

419
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,850
- That's a good idea.
 -  Yes.

420
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,100
It'll be done quickly.

421
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,430
You take care of me better than my mum.

422
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,000
It's so nice to have someone in my house.

423
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,070
- You should eat well.
 -  Okay.

424
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,870
I know how it feels because...

425
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,010
I'm not so different from you.

426
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,350
- Really?
 -  But there is...

427
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,000
something I learned.

428
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,870
I eat fruits no matter what.

429
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,970
I'm trying to eat fruits more often.

430
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,240
Eating fruits makes a big difference.

431
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,740
- Let's sit side by side.
 -  Okay.

432
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,370
- Isn't nice to have a dining table?
 -  It's so good.

433
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,200
- It's good, but...
 -  Yes.

434
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:22,170
I was criticised so much because of this.

435
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,100
I read those comments, too, as I check them all the time.

436
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,470
- Did you?
 -  Of course.

437
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,670
- Someone said, "Hyun Moo is cool."
 -  Right.

438
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,530
I hadn't read a good comment like that...

439
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,270
in two years.

440
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,070
At least, you got good comments. I'm happy for you.

441
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,000
I felt bad for you.

442
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,300
I said I didn't need the table.

443
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,530
Why would they criticise you?

444
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:43,570
When you were criticised for selling my sketch,

445
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,790
I read some comments about you saying,

446
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,300
"He's always like that. I don't even want to see his face."

447
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,970
(They don't even want to see his face?)

448
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,430
I thought you had done so much wrong.

449
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,370
They said, "He's always like that."

450
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,630
I have a bad image.

451
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,600
Harsh comments hurt your feelings at first.

452
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,700
When I read harsh comments about me for the first time,

453
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,240
I couldn't go outside.

454
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:05,890
Why?

455
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,970
I thought everyone hated me.

456
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,570
Think about it.

457
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,680
I get hurt easily, too.

458
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,450
- But it's better than no comment.
 -  I see.

459
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,790
- It's true.
 -  You're right.

460
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,800
- It's the same for my webtoon.
 -  Of course.

461
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,130
Actually,

462
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,000
I overcame it by getting used to it.

463
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,540
I read harsh comments more often.

464
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,740
There are...

465
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,700
constructive criticisms and meaningless ones.

466
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,740
- There are logical criticisms...
 -  Yes.

467
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,870
that explain why my behaviours or words cause an issue.

468
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,360
- They really hurt my feelings.
 -  I understand.

469
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,920
- But I can accept them.
 -  I know how it feels.

470
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,020
That's right.

471
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,280
There are a few of them.

472
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,220
The rest are all meaningless. "I hate you."

473
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,600
"I don't want to see your face." "Go away."

474
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,170
"You're despicable." They have no reasonable ground.

475
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,200
- What can I do about it?
 -  I...

476
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
I can't just tell them, "I'm actually adorable."

477
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,870
You wouldn't understand if you haven't read harsh comments.

478
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,630
When you read one for the first time,

479
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,740
it feels like everyone hates you.

480
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,570
Kian84 must feel like he's lost everything.

481
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,970
I wanted to let him know that he hasn't.

482
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,400
I managed to overcome it by myself.

483
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,900
It's like growing pains. It happens a lot.

484
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,090
- I think it's done.
 -  It looks delicious.

485
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,860
- Indeed. Shall we eat now?
 -  Let's eat.

486
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,200
It looks amazing.

487
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
(It's steaming.)

488
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,170
Thank you.

489
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,830
Don't mention it.

490
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,130
Be careful.

491
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,800
I should put it away.

492
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,900
(It's too hot.)

493
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,210
Do you have salt?

494
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,060
I don't have salt at home.

495
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,740
- What about chilli pepper powder?
 -  I don't have it.

496
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,530
- Do you not have pepper, either?
 -  No.

497
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,740
- Let's eat it as it is.
 -  Okay.

498
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,700
(He's forced to have a low sodium diet.)

499
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,500
This is real sagol.

500
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,870
It'll be good for our bodies.

501
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,700
(He adds a bowl of warm rice to it.)

502
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,300
(This is nice.)

503
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,100
(You can't leave out aged kimchi.)

504
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,800
- How is it?
 -  It's delicious.

505
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,740
You'll thank me later. You have to eat this kind of food.

506
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,740
Samgyetang, fish...

507
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,970
(It's hard to eat well when you live alone.)

508
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,770
and gomtang...

509
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,830
You have to eat these kinds of food.

510
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,470
It's delicious.

511
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,240
(The warmth of the soup spreads though their bodies.)

512
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,430
- It's good.
 -  It is, isn't it?

513
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,870
It's very good.

514
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,900
(They're fighting heat with heat.)

515
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,000
This is nice.

516
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,470
Why did I take a shower? We're drenched in sweat.

517
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,830
(They're practically at a sauna.)

518
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,870
That's nice.

519
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,500
(He drinks up his bowl of soup.)

520
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,240
Thank you for the food.

521
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,800
I had good food, thanks to you.

522
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,600
This is the first time I've had sagol this year.

523
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,840
- Really?
 -  Yes.

524
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,930
I'm full.

525
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,800
Let me help.

526
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,970
(They do the dishes right away.)

527
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,960
(He sweats profusely after the meal.)

528
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,370
(The tissue sticks to his face.)

529
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,700
(This is Kian84's simple way of doing the dishes.)

530
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,090
(He fills the bowl with water...)

531
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,370
(and dumps it out.)

532
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,770
(What?)

533
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,370
Are you done?

534
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,800
Was my bowl washed like this?

535
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,220
Yes, I washed it like that earlier.

536
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,300
Are you serious?

537
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,670
I don't believe you.

538
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
(He washes the dishes again.)

539
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,500
(He's still sweating.)

540
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,870
Hyun Moo, are you trying to look good on TV?

541
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,300
I don't want people to criticise me.

542
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,460
Actually, it's not because of what people think of me.

543
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,200
I like doing the dishes.

544
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,500
You like doing the dishes?

545
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,100
I realised something after being on this show.

546
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,730
I know what people like...

547
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,600
and what they don't. I become conscious of that.

548
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:54,130
I also started wondering why Hyun Moo was doing the dishes...

549
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,630
and why he keeps giving me food.

550
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,730
I kept thinking about it.

551
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,170
I don't know why.

552
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,570
I was becoming paranoid, thinking there's an ulterior motive.

553
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,200
Turn the fan on at least.

554
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,300
That feels cool.

555
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,820
It's very hot today.

556
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,650
It's too hot.

557
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,700
Not even my mum does the dishes.

558
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,260
Are you sure you like doing the dishes?

559
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,430
Yes, I do. Why?

560
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,770
That's why I don't cook. I can't leave dirty dishes around.

561
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,870
(He sweats profusely with every step.)

562
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:32,900
It's hot.

563
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,870
That was a nice meal.

564
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,570
Should we have some peaches?

565
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,070
Let's eat it whole.

566
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,070
(Let's just eat it whole.)

567
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,370
(Hyun Moo brought the peaches.)

568
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,270
(He bites into the peach.)

569
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,770
- It's good, isn't it?
 -  Yes, it is.

570
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,530
How's it so hard?

571
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,670
It used to be harder.

572
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,830
- It's softer now.
 -  It is?

573
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:58,600
Yes, I left it out for too long.

574
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,030
(How will they survive the hot and humid night?)

575
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,270
(What is Gook Ju doing in the heat?)

576
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,600
She lives in a nice neighbourhood.

577
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,870
(She's visiting someone.)

578
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,770
You can have everything delivered if you live in this area.

579
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,500
It's a flat.

580
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,670
(Who lives here?)

581
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,780
I wonder if she's cleaning.

582
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,070
All she has to prepare is food.

583
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,630
(She has nothing to eat at home, but she's cleaning.)

584
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,700
(She wipes the table with a wet wipe.)

585
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,670
I'll try to look like a model.

586
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,800
(She shakes her head side to side.)

587
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,870
Hi.

588
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm Model Lee Gook Ju.

589
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,430
(She tries to look sexy by blowing wind in her hair.)

590
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,800
The weather is too hot.

591
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,130
(She rushes out.)

592
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,670
The weather is too hot.

593
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,300
(This is Gook Ju's first time visiting Hye Jin's home.)

594
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,370
Hi, it's so cool in here.

595
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,430
It's so cool.

596
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,570
Wear these.

597
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,670
- These?
 -  Yes, I left them out for you.

598
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,670
My feet are sweaty. Is it okay if the slippers smell?

599
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,970
It's okay. I'll throw them out.

600
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,340
Wow.

601
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,200
When I first met her,

602
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:05,270
I had a feeling we'd get along.

603
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,500
(She saw Hye Jin order food early in the morning.)

604
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,460
I live on the 11th floor.

605
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,200
I can tell when the food is almost here.

606
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,500
I wait outside.

607
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:17,270
I open the door when I think the food is at my doorstep.

608
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,930
This would go well with soju.

609
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,900
She's just like me.

610
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,370
It's there when I open the door.

611
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:27,140
I don't easily open up to other people.

612
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,200
But I asked for her number right away.

613
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,730
I wanted to get to know her better.

614
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,520
Thankfully, she invited me over.

615
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,730
I want to talk with her today...

616
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,230
and get to know her better.

617
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,100
What's this?

618
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,700
I brought a gift.

619
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,670
It's pretty heavy.

620
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:47,270
Last time, I saw you...

621
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,900
drink wine out of a packet.

622
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,340
- I've tried soju out of a packet.
 -  I didn't know that existed.

623
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,280
- It's fills one glass?
 -  One glass?

624
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,670
This is way better than that.

625
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,460
- Way better?
 -  Yes.

626
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,040
It has more class and is made with more sincerity.

627
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,930
It's much better.

628
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,670
Take a look at it.

629
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,600
What's this?

630
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,630
Is it snake wine?

631
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,380
Does it have a snake in it?

632
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,760
Is that what you wanted?

633
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,830
It's bokbunja ju.

634
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,170
- Really?
 -  Yes.

635
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,760
I used to make a lot of it.

636
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,500
I gave it out to the Rainbow Club members.

637
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,730
Really?

638
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,430
I wanted to give you a bottle as well.

639
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:27,000
(She makes a face as she adds the bokbunja.)

640
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,730
(She pours the alcohol in it.)

641
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,270
(She mixes the berries with alcohol to make bokbunja ju.)

642
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,370
Is that enough?

643
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,600
(Let's try it.)

644
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,670
She's trying it right away.

645
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,100
(She's excited to try the wine.)

646
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,000
- You couldn't wait?
 -  It's alcohol.

647
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,030
Yes, it is.

648
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,600
- I drink every day.
 -  It's really alcohol.

649
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,500
You made this?

650
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,170
(She lets out a sound of satisfaction.)

651
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,000
It's strong.

652
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,160
Yes, it is.

653
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,370
- It's strong.
 -  Do you know how I felt?

654
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,140
It reminded me of cognac.

655
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,400
It warmed my chest up.

656
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,470
Me, too.

657
00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:00,660
I wonder if all the other members are drinking it.

658
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,520
- It's only 2:30 in the afternoon.
 -  This feels weird.

659
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,170
It made my heart race.

660
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,730
I feel like I got an IV with wine.

661
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,030
I feel like it's still flowing in me.

662
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,000
Let's have it chilled.

663
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,600
- Okay, put it in the refrigerator.
 -  It'll be better chilled.

664
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,830
- Wow.
 -  What is it?

665
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,170
It's so empty.

666
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,760
What's this? It's a huge disappointment.

667
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,730
I have to go grocery shopping.

668
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,430
This is it.

669
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,100
This is white wine.

670
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,370
Stop that.

671
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,870
I'll give you a few when you go home.

672
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:35,100
I was in Hong Kong for vacation...

673
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,300
Come on.

674
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,170
You froze your food waste again.

675
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,300
It's because I knew you were coming.

676
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,000
You should've thrown it out, not freeze it.

677
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,870
Now my hands are sticky.

678
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,300
I cleaned the whole place for you.

679
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,730
But that trash is from this morning.

680
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,030
I didn't know you'd open my freezer.

681
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,900
- I open everything.
 -  Wait.

682
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,500
Wait a second.

683
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,120
I see a bike.

684
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,830
I only go in there to do the laundry.

685
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,130
I'm going to take a thorough look around.

686
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,600
(Gook Ju checks every corner of the flat.)

687
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,030
This is a model's room.

688
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,070
This is embarrassing. I don't have much.

689
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:16,590
(Top Model Hye Jin's room is simpler than we expected.)

690
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,200
You're tall.

691
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,640
- Your closet is longer than most.
 -  How did you know?

692
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,700
- I customised the closet.
 -  I could tell.

693
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,170
Normal people don't need this.

694
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,060
We don't need taller closets.

695
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,170
Look at this.

696
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,500
Isn't this a weightlifter?

697
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,570
(She's holding strong on to a bar.)

698
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,300
I've never seen anyone say that.

699
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,500
It looks like the weights should be attached to the bar.

700
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,800
You look like a weightlifter at the Olympics.

701
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,470
That's cool.

702
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,900
I'll show you what it is.

703
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,100
(It's the cover of a fashion magazine.)

704
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,000
You're on the cover of a magazine. I want to be on one, too.

705
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,760
I was on the cover of a magazine once.

706
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,590
I want to try something like this.

707
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,170
How did you look?

708
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,300
- Me?
 -  Yes.

709
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,530
I looked strong and powerful.

710
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,070
I have my poses.

711
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,170
I like biting my finger.

712
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,570
You did that for the cover of a magazine?

713
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,910
(This is what she did.)

714
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,370
- It was just my face.
 -  Just your face?

715
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:15,130
Not many people get to do that.

716
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,570
It's something only top celebrities can do.

717
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,600
Here it is.

718
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:23,070
The dress is open at the back.

719
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,400
You're sitting on a chair.

720
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,230
You have your arms laying on the armrest.

721
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,480
This makes your legs look short.

722
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,830
I'll show you how to sit.

723
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,470
I need to learn this.

724
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,470
This is how you were sitting.

725
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,600
This is how models sit.

726
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,100
We sit at the edge of the chair.

727
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,200
Sit at the edge.

728
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,670
- I sat comfortably in the chair.
 -  First, sit at the edge.

729
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,610
Lean sideways and make an S shape with your body.

730
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,350
- I see.
 -  Then stretch your legs.

731
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,840
Stretch those as far as you can.

732
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,030
You can stretch them like this.

733
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:54,930
You want to look like this.

734
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,850
You look uncomfortable.

735
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,930
You won't look good in the pictures if you're comfortable.

736
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:01,180
You could sit on the other side.

737
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,480
This is something people were curious about.

738
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,500
You want to sit like this even when taking selfies.

739
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,030
Like this.

740
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,460
(This is how you sit in a chair.)

741
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,720
Wow.

742
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,300
My old pictures are mixed with recent ones.

743
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,270
- You're lying down, aren't you?
 -  How did you know?

744
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,130
(She is riding a bike while lying on the floor.)

745
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:28,260
You know how to make fashion look funny.

746
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,830
You have a keen eye.

747
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,170
I used to draw.

748
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,530
My dream was to become a fashion designer.

749
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,570
- Objet...
 -  Objet designs?

750
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,400
That time, I used to buy...

751
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,730
three magazines like this every month.

752
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:45,090
I put all of them in my scrapbook.

753
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,800
I couldn't study fashion because my grades weren't good.

754
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,270
(They both love fashion.)

755
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,800
I should've studied. Gosh, this...

756
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,300
(She looks at a different magazine.)

757
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,010
(She looks scary.)

758
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:59,670
Wait... This...

759
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:02,780
I think it's 1:55pm.

760
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:06,200
- I think it's cute.
 -  I was very angry at the time.

761
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,590
I lived abroad then. I was an angry kid.

762
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,500
I can see the anger in your eyes.

763
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,730
I was an angry girl.

764
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,670
(She exuded her anger.)

765
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,300
Think about it.

766
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,030
If comedians did this, it'd be too funny.

767
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:24,030
What do you mean? You always made fun of us.

768
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,000
Jang Do Yeon and Park Na Rae did that.

769
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,170
Did you call me?

770
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:31,100
I saw that pose before.

771
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,340
(I saw that pose before.)

772
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,500
This is it.

773
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,870
(They started to laugh out loud.)

774
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,470
(We found it.)

775
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:40,500
Jang Do Yeon Jang Do Yeon

776
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:44,370
It's because models always do the same pose.

777
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,920
What else can we do?

778
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,570
First we do the standard poses. Later,

779
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,920
we face forward, turn around and do a bunch of things.

780
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,070
When the photographer asks for something different...

781
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,500
- I see.
 -  Are you happy?

782
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,340
My stomach.

783
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,770
I think I drank too much.

784
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:02,200
My stomach hurts.

785
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,840
(The hangover pose)

786
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,730
- This is what that is.
 -  Yes.

787
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,100
- Gosh, you were so young.
 -  I was.

788
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:14,370
Look at the clothes. It's crazy.

789
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,830
Gosh. That's Gang Dong Won. That's awesome.

790
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,370
(Gang Dong Won when he was a model)

791
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,940
Gosh.

792
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,500
That's awesome. Look at his eyes.

793
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:25,670
(This is...)

794
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,020
(Zo In Sung, Gook Ju's ideal man.)

795
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,800
I can't believe it.

796
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:33,170
Choose either Zo In Sung or Gang Dong Won. On 1, 2, 3.

797
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,600
(She blanks out.)

798
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,870
Zo In Sung or Kang Dong Won. On 1, 2, 3.

799
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,430
(Zo In Sung versus Gang Dong Won)

800
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,100
I just want to see if we like the same type or not.

801
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,470
- This is hard.
 -  I know.

802
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,970
- It's too hard.
 -  What shall we do?

803
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,170
It's hard because...

804
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,830
- they're both perfect.
 -  Wait.

805
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,900
- I'll download the app.
 -  Is there an app for this?

806
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,600
You haven't tried it yet?

807
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,470
- Gosh.
 -  I only tried it on the show.

808
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:00,630
- Well...
 -  Why do you do it by yourself?

809
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,900
- This is really interesting.
 -  Really?

810
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,580
I play this three times before I go to sleep.

811
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,700
They appear in your dreams, seriously.

812
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,860
- Why do you do this?
 -  Wait.

813
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,570
Do they really appear in your dreams?

814
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:13,620
Ideal men type...

815
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,050
- Ideal Actor World Cup.
 -  Okay.

816
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,370
Lee Jong Hyun versus Kim Woo Bin.

817
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,370
Okay, it's Lee Jong Hyun versus Kim Woo Bin.

818
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,070
On a hot day, a man brings you a cold drink.

819
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:29,030
He takes a sip and passes it to you.

820
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,520
Why does he have to sip it first?

821
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,700
It's almost like a kiss.

822
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,030
One, two, three.

823
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,370
- Kim Woo Bin.
 -  Kim Woo Bin, let's go.

824
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:40,200
We have the same taste.

825
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:43,400
Kim Ji Seok versus Lee Jang Woo.

826
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,370
- One, two, three.
 -  Wait.

827
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,470
(Wait)

828
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,300
(She pretended not to be interested, but now she's into it.)

829
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,730
- Think about it.
 -  Wait.

830
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:54,770
- This is quite nerve-racking.
 -  It's really hot right now.

831
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:57,630
You're sweating.

832
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,670
- All of a sudden, wind is blowing.
 -  Okay.

833
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:02,900
You turn around. A man is fanning you and smiling at you.

834
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,970
Who do you want it to be?

835
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:06,420
Kim Ji Seok or Lee Jang Woo. One, two, three.

836
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,760
(Kim Ji Seok versus Lee Jang Woo)

837
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,820
- Kim Ji Seok.
 -  Okay, let's go.

838
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,600
We have the same taste.

839
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,470
This is getting worse.

840
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,360
- Okay, next.
 -  Here it is.

841
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,470
- Joo Won versus Kwon Yul.
 -  Joo Won.

842
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,770
Joo Won? I see.

843
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,260
Well, I...

844
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,830
So he's your type.

845
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:27,470
No. I usually don't like people with strong features.

846
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,200
When I was filming "Fashion King"...

847
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,300
I spent much time with Joo Won.

848
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,770
In the movie,

849
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:40,430
- he wears a T-shirt with me on it.
 -  I see.

850
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,900
Well... I shouldn't say this on TV.

851
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,200
Why not? You keep doing this.

852
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,070
He's going to find out how I thought of him then.

853
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:56,170
You shouldn't hide it. You have to say it.

854
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:58,930
Did you like him wearing a T-shirt with you on it?

855
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:02,110
My heart was going to burst.

856
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,770
Like when you drank bokbunja ju before?

857
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,880
My heart was pounding.

858
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,600
I saw him for the first time then.

859
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,530
It was like when I saw a handsome actor.

860
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,530
I was like, "Who's this guy?"

861
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,800
(I thought my heart was going to stop.)

862
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,640
I think Joo Won is number one right now.

863
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,900
Kim Ji Seok versus Lee Je Hoon.

864
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,020
This is unfair for me.

865
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,100
You won't be able to choose anyone in the finals.

866
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:29,170
- Why am I so torn?
 -  You're...

867
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,730
meeting him at the airport to go on a trip secretly.

868
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,680
He appears with a mask and a cap on.

869
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,910
- You're so funny.
 -  You'd say, "Hey, you're here."

870
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:39,500
He whispers in your ears,

871
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,100
"Let's meet at the duty-free shop later."

872
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,730
Why meet at a duty-free shop?

873
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:46,870
- Why not on the plane?
 -  You have to...

874
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:49,140
buy a bottle of wine.

875
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,570
Imagine him whispering in your ears.

876
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,730
Kim Ji Seok goes...

877
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:58,290
- well with this situation.
 -  Okay, Kim Ji Seok.

878
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:00,570
- What's all this?
 -  Okay, it's the finals.

879
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,800
(Kim Ji Seok versus Joo Won)

880
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:04,170
Without wearing a shirt.

881
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:07,200
- A girl not wearing a shirt?
 -  No, a man.

882
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,430
Shirtless like this.

883
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,930
(He's cooking for you and showing off his muscles.)

884
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:12,640
He's cooking like this.

885
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,830
"It'll be done soon."

886
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,770
Who would you choose?

887
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:23,700
Joo Won. She picked Joo Won.

888
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,930
It was Joo Won from the beginning.

889
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,230
Gosh, what am I going to do?

890
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,200
- Shall I save his picture?
 -  What?

891
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,800
- You can save it.
 -  Don't do it.

892
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,930
I can save this picture. I'll send it to you.

893
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:36,070
- Don't do it.
 -  Shall I send it to you?

894
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:41,860
- No, it's okay. I'm embarrassed.
 -  Why?

895
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:45,570
Girls talk about boys when we get together.

896
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,430
We talk about the people we're interested in.

897
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,370
We talk about handsome guys we saw.

898
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:53,030
It doesn't matter if you're a comedian or a model.

899
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:55,730
It's the topic girls talk about when we get together.

900
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:58,730
We got along great and we had fun.

901
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,800
I think I'll treat her as my big sister.

902
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,000
(We're friends forever.)

903
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,970
- You saw them all.
 -  Yes.

904
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:06,870
Who's your favourite?

905
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,400
- There's one guy.
 -  Who is it?

906
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,140
- Maybe I should learn Chinese.
 -  What are you saying?

907
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,600
Do you know Darren Wang?

908
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,800
No. That's his name?

909
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,100
- You don't know him?
 -  Is he...

910
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,920
Chinese? It that his name?

911
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,570
There was a movie that was recommended.

912
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,860
- It's called "Our Times".
 -  Okay.

913
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,430
He's so charming in the movie.

914
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:31,300
- Darren Wang is?
 -  Yes, I'll show you.

915
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,670
Do we have the same TV?

916
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,830
Wait, I'll turn it on.

917
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,100
(I'll show you the movie he's in.)

918
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:40,030
(Our Times)

919
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,480
- Did you eat yet?
 -  No.

920
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,570
I thought about sundaeguk on the way here.

921
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,500
- Come on.
 -  Sundaeguk.

922
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,000
(Hye Jin eating sundaeguk in the morning...)

923
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:54,100
(left a deep impression on Gook Ju.)

924
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:58,160
- I actually drank last night.
 -  I see.

925
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,730
- We can eat while watching TV.
 -  Sundaeguk would be good then.

926
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,970
I just have to call my favourite place.

927
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,730
Please bring two from Cheongdam-dong.

928
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,280
Please bring 1 kkakdugi and 1 sliced radish.

929
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,370
Okay. Would you like to add a bowl of rice?

930
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:17,870
A bowl of rice should come with it for free.

931
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,470
I need to check.

932
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,140
- I know for sure.
 -  Thank you.

933
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,370
(I finally get to eat it.)

934
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,030
(It's time to meet Darren Wang.)

935
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,300
After I watched this,

936
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,350
I wanted to experience an innocent love again.

937
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:35,570
- You really enjoyed this movie.
 -  Yes.

938
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,370
Look. It's the cafeteria.

939
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,100
The noodles.

940
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,800
I can play that role.

941
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,200
(Gook Ju would've played that role if the movie was Korean.)

942
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,370
I want jjamppong all of a sudden.

943
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,600
But there wasn't anything about jjamppong in the movie.

944
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,000
I feel like having jjamppong.

945
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,530
(I'm craving it.)

946
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,250
- Let's order it.
 -  What?

947
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,670
- Pause the movie.
 -  How will you eat it?

948
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,100
Of course, I can.

949
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,080
- All right. Let's order.
 -  Okay.

950
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,390
Jjamppong.

951
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:05,200
You said jjamppong first, not me.

952
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,300
Yes, I get to eat jjamppong and sundaeguk.

953
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,270
I should wait for sundaeguk while waiting for jjamppong.

954
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:13,470
I want one jjamppong...

955
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,070
and a jjajangmyeon.

956
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,140
I told you, you're greedy.

957
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,820
(She's my type.)

958
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,470
We have to order jjajangmyeon.

959
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,640
You mentioned jjamppong first.

960
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,200
- The two shouldn't arrive together.
 -  Why not?

961
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,900
- Then...
 -  One should come first.

962
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,480
It they arrive at once, I can't eat a lot.

963
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,470
No worries. We can eat.

964
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,280
Let's see what kind of other food is hidden.

965
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,600
What are we watching? Darren Whang or the food?

966
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:40,730
(Darren Wang appears finally.)

967
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:41,800
He's handsome.

968
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:44,930
He is handsome.

969
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,470
It's as if he's looking at me.

970
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,300
I'll say this when I meet him.

971
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,670
- What does it mean?
 -  What's your phone number?

972
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,700
You're funny.

973
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,070
(Only those who are prepared gets handsome men.)

974
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,870
- I really like him these days.
 -  Who?

975
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,140
(I really like him these days.)

976
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:09,030
I even wrote down his blog address.

977
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,100
Xiumin.

978
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,770
(Xiumin of EXO)

979
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,640
From here, you're different from me.

980
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,000
- He's just so cute.
 -  He's cute.

981
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,280
(They talk freely about boys now that they're close.)

982
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,430
Look at you.

983
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,070
- You look so happy.
 -  Well...

984
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:26,300
You look the happiest since I came here.

985
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:32,070
(They're immersed in the movie.)

986
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:37,050
- Is it going to be sundaeguk?
 -  No.

987
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,300
I think it's Chinese food.

988
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,940
(Which one arrived first?)

989
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,770
- Yes?
 -  What is it, Hye Jin?

990
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:44,600
Our Chinese food arrived. As usual, they're fast.

991
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,870
We have to eat the noodles first.

992
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:47,030
(It looks delicious.)

993
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,500
- Yes.
 -  Oh, no.

994
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,800
I'm so happy.

995
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,980
Let's eat.

996
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,030
I can't spill.

997
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,140
I'm in trouble.

998
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,640
If you don't mind the calories, you won't gain weight.

999
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,170
(If you're happy with your food, you won't gain weight.)

1000
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,410
(She's getting the remaining sauce with the noodles.)

1001
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:03,430
Wow, Hye Jin.

1002
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,770
You're not wasting any of it.

1003
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,470
You're so frugal.

1004
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,020
- Well...
 -  That's smart.

1005
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,230
There isn't enough sauce.

1006
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,640
(It looks delicious.)

1007
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,670
Relax and eat today.

1008
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,220
(She eats with her mouth.)

1009
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,870
He's so handsome.

1010
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,830
Oh, my goodness.

1011
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,500
- He has a very nice smile.
 -  Right.

1012
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,270
(It feels we're in a paradise.)

1013
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,600
(Sighing)

1014
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,140
Are you treating your hangover?

1015
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,270
I don't need to apply lip gloss.

1016
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,300
(Because the soup is oily.)

1017
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,430
(She's not even listening.)

1018
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,890
You're not even listening.

1019
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:46,350
You're just waiting for the doorbell to ring.

1020
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,580
It's so obvious.

1021
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,850
- Sorry.
 -  I really...

1022
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:50,080
Right?

1023
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,840
I'm still talking.

1024
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,070
You're so eager to get the door.

1025
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,500
(The sundaeguk comes first.)

1026
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,740
The door is open.

1027
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,850
Hold on, Darren Wang.

1028
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:59,000
(Goodness)

1029
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,930
He's looking at me.

1030
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,300
Hye Jin...

1031
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:06,060
I can't set the table.

1032
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,410
- Why not?
 -  He's staring at me.

1033
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:10,600
- Gosh.
 -  I'm going insane.

1034
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:13,430
He's looking over there.

1035
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,230
Hello, Darren.

1036
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,700
Gosh.

1037
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,280
(Hye Jin opens the sundaeguk roughly.)

1038
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,300
You're strong.

1039
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,930
You have to pierce it.

1040
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,000
- We need this.
 -  Right.

1041
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,210
(They start eating with the TV paused.)

1042
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:29,500
This is great.

1043
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,820
- Your hangover will get better.
 -  Right.

1044
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,530
I drank too much last night.

1045
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,100
How late were you out?

1046
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,300
- Until 3:30am.
 -  Really?

1047
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,300
(Gook Ju drank until 3:30am.)

1048
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,970
We started drinking at 11pm.

1049
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:41,090
You started late.

1050
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,210
Do you know how much meat the five of us ate?

1051
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,770
We ate 850 dollars' worth of meat.

1052
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,530
There must have been guys there.

1053
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,370
They were all guys except for me.

1054
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:50,640
Really?

1055
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,780
No way.

1056
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,400
- Really?
 -  You want to see the photos?

1057
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,530
What's your secret?

1058
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,870
I'm not their type.

1059
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,770
They're comfortable with me.

1060
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:02,820
I see.

1061
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,700
I'm not threatening.

1062
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:07,160
They just see me as a good friend.

1063
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,150
- I must be threatening.
 -  I guess.

1064
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:11,520
I act like a mother to them.

1065
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,270
- Motherly?
 -  Then all of a sudden,

1066
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,590
I act like a real woman.

1067
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:18,000
You go from being motherly to being ladylike?

1068
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,190
Have you ever dated anyone like that?

1069
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,730
- Yes.
 -  Really?

1070
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,770
It never happens right away.

1071
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:28,030
When I show my interest,

1072
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:30,620
- the guys tend to back off.
 -  Right.

1073
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,160
You become friends.

1074
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,230
Later on, they say,

1075
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,140
"I kept thinking about you."

1076
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,600
- "You're a really good woman."
 -  I see.

1077
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:40,720
You were always...

1078
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,200
friends before dating, right?

1079
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,170
I'd do anything for the man I love.

1080
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,080
That's just like me.

1081
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,400
When people talk about relationships,

1082
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,830
I disagree with the saying that...

1083
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:58,270
people who give it their all tend to regret it less.

1084
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:01,000
I think that's nonsense.

1085
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,430
I'm serious.

1086
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:05,460
It's a lot more difficult for the person who gives more.

1087
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,620
- It's more difficult.
 -  It's more painful.

1088
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:08,800
It's more painful, too.

1089
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,300
I always remember the gifts I gave.

1090
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,300
(I always remember the gifts I gave.)

1091
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,830
I calculate the cost.

1092
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:17,370
I drove my ex-boyfriends around a lot.

1093
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:18,800
That's a given.

1094
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,270
- You did that, too?
 -  Of course.

1095
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:23,170
(They're bitter.)

1096
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,900
I've done everything men usually do for women.

1097
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,670
I picked them up...

1098
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,160
- and paid for drinks and meals.
 -  You waited for them.

1099
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,930
I prepared special events for them...

1100
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:34,500
- You're just like me.
 -  with friends.

1101
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,230
(We're the same.)

1102
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:41,580
When shopping, I spend more on my boyfriend...

1103
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:44,040
than on myself.

1104
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,570
During those times,

1105
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:49,200
- You rationalise.
 -  Right.

1106
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,760
"I'm buying myself something, too."

1107
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,660
"I'm not just buying him things."

1108
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:55,520
I rationalise it.

1109
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,870
My feelings are sincere.

1110
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,170
I'm sincere.

1111
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,300
(They're so alike.)

1112
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,830
The sundaeguk is delicious.

1113
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:07,460
There's not enough sundae.

1114
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,200
Do you want some of mine? I like the other stuff.

1115
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,530
- Really?
 -  Yes.

1116
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:13,300
(Single women sharing sundaeguk)

1117
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:15,430
Dating is...

1118
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:17,300
really exhausting.

1119
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,930
Are they here?

1120
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:23,100
(Kian84's house is 35°C.)

1121
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:24,730
(He rushes over.)

1122
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:25,730
Yes?

1123
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:27,730
That was quick.

1124
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:29,130
(Are they here?)

1125
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:31,530
- Hello.
 -  Hello.

1126
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:32,800
Thank you for coming so late.

1127
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:35,670
- I'm sorry.
 -  Sorry for arriving late.

1128
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:38,100
- I didn't think you'd arrive.
 -  Sorry.

1129
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,740
How long will it take?

1130
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,370
Around an hour and a half.

1131
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:42,570
- An hour and a half.
 -  Really?

1132
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,510
- Kian84.
 -  Yes?

1133
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:46,630
Can we please leave?

1134
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:49,300
- You want to go out?
 -  I'm dying.

1135
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:52,790
Can you call me 10 minutes before you're done?

1136
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,600
- I'll come home.
 -  All right.

1137
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,300
- Thank you.
 -  Thank you.

1138
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,800
- All right.
 -  Thank you.

1139
00:44:58,530 --> 00:44:59,800
- Let's go.
 -  Let's go.

1140
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,620
Put these slippers on, Hyun Moo.

1141
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,370
- Can I borrow them?
 -  Here they are.

1142
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:05,770
All right.

1143
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:09,300
(They look like twins.)

1144
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,930
It's so cool.

1145
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:13,410
Is it?

1146
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:16,160
If the air conditioner hadn't come,

1147
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,970
we could've slept here in a tent.

1148
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:19,970
It's cool out here.

1149
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:22,430
It's cool, but how can we sleep here?

1150
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:24,130
Your house is the hottest place.

1151
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:25,730
(Your house is the hottest place.)

1152
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,370
(Neighbourhood commercial area)

1153
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:30,160
- Let's go.
 -  Let's go to the arcade.

1154
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,630
It's been a while since I've gone to those places.

1155
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:36,430
It's like going out after midterms.

1156
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:37,700
(They're the excited slipper brothers.)

1157
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:38,970
Wearing slippers like this.

1158
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,650
Did you go to arcades a lot?

1159
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:42,380
That's why I had to retake my college admission test.

1160
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:44,080
It was because of football games.

1161
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,070
You had to reapply because of football video games?

1162
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:48,300
I entered a tournament and failed to get into college.

1163
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:51,130
(Arcade)

1164
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,630
(Let's battle.)

1165
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:57,900
(There can only be one winner at the arcade.)

1166
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:02,300
(I'm the Tekken master.)

1167
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,630
(Expert hand movements)

1168
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,600
(He slides over...)

1169
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,630
(and counterpunches.)

1170
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,170
(He wins.)

1171
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:16,630
(Despite Hyun Moo's attacks,)

1172
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:18,200
(he wins again.)

1173
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:20,430
(Chuckling)

1174
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:23,430
(In an instant, Hyun Moo loses three times.)

1175
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,930
(I win.)

1176
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:31,610
Don't cry, Hyun Moo.

1177
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:33,040
You're no match for me.

1178
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,300
(He becomes enraged.)

1179
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:37,730
(He furiously pushes any buttons.)

1180
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,530
(Hyun Moo's rage...)

1181
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,600
(catches the expert off guard.)

1182
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,630
What's going on?

1183
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,830
(Here I come.)

1184
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:48,610
What's this?

1185
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:49,670
That's it.

1186
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:51,770
Destroy him.

1187
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:52,770
(Destroy him.)

1188
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:54,170
He's good.

1189
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:56,500
(I don't know what's happening either.)

1190
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,630
Destroy him.

1191
00:46:58,570 --> 00:46:59,600
That's it.

1192
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:02,130
(Is he fighting with his facial expressions?)

1193
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:04,300
What's this?

1194
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,500
(Hyun Moo beats Kian84.)

1195
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:08,410
(He's newbie who got lucky.)

1196
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:09,500
Wow.

1197
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,230
(The expert is bitter.)

1198
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:13,000
(They're giving it everything they have.)

1199
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,270
I can't punch.

1200
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:17,490
(When Hyun Moo shakes his leg,)

1201
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:18,800
(his character kicks.)

1202
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,930
What's this?

1203
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:27,800
I was completely winning at first.

1204
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:30,570
Then I went easy on him and lost a round.

1205
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:33,700
I thought I should let him win a round.

1206
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,690
He's older and went to the arcade with me.

1207
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:39,070
I didn't want to go overboard.

1208
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,200
So I let him win.

1209
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:44,660
(After the battle, they head upstairs.)

1210
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:47,100
It's so cool in here.

1211
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,300
Each floor is great.

1212
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,530
(Hyun Moo and Kian84 head to a karaoke.)

1213
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:51,150
Let's sing for an hour.

1214
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:52,530
- All right.
 -  Hello.

1215
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:53,570
- Hello.
 -  It's so cool.

1216
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,260
This is a room for two.

1217
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:58,670
It's been a while since I've been to a karaoke.

1218
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:02,760
What songs do you like? Ballads?

1219
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,830
I like ballads.

1220
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:05,100
Really?

1221
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,920
When it's just guys, we always sing ballads.

1222
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,370
- I sing ballads, too.
 -  Right.

1223
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:10,960
When there are women, you sing idol songs...

1224
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,730
- to liven up the mood, right?
 -  Right.

1225
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:14,630
We're all about the emotion though.

1226
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,620
Men love Cho Jang Hyuk.

1227
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,730
In my generation, it was Yarn and Yada.

1228
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:20,530
I also like Buzz.

1229
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,390
Buzz? How about Kim Sung Myun from K2?

1230
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:25,700
We used to sing those songs during the entire hour.

1231
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,250
That's just like me.

1232
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,230
(Kian84's first song)

1233
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:31,270
This song is difficult.

1234
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:33,400
The person with the higher score...

1235
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,570
(The winner gets to sleep in the living room.)

1236
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:36,530
- sleeps in the living room.
 -  In the living room?

1237
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:38,830
The loser has to sleep in the hot bedroom.

1238
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:40,130
(He got startled.)

1239
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,300
(He misses a beat.)

1240
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:44,830
(Just a person like me)

1241
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:45,870
I won.

1242
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:47,770
I won.

1243
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:51,000
(It's impossible to recognise the original song.)

1244
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:52,990
That's incredible.

1245
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:56,130
(He shakes his foot in preparation for the high note.)

1246
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:58,900
What's this?

1247
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,000
Here comes the climax.

1248
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:06,030
(He's shaking his foot to sing the high notes.)

1249
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:10,970
(I reveal myself)

1250
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:13,700
(Unintentionally)

1251
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:17,130
(He's lost it.)

1252
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:25,230
(You don't know how much I want to sleep in peace.)

1253
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:28,200
I'll sing something else. It's too difficult.

1254
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:31,920
I used to be able to hit the high notes.

1255
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,290
- You have no sense of rhythm.
 -  Right.

1256
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:34,910
It's been a while since I sang.

1257
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:36,170
- You were completely off beat.
 -  Right.

1258
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:38,300
Your voice is great though.

1259
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:42,680
I'm relaxed because you started off like that.

1260
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,300
- Really?
 -  It won't matter how I sing.

1261
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,670
- It was that bad?
 -  You've got a serious issue.

1262
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:47,800
Really?

1263
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,900
I'll sing "Eyes, Nose, Lips".

1264
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,570
That's a tough one.

1265
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:54,230
(Don't say sorry)

1266
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:57,400
(It makes me feel pitiful)

1267
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:01,600
(The listener feels out of breath.)

1268
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,570
(I'm okay)

1269
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:07,300
(Your eyes, nose and lips)

1270
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:11,000
(He adds soul to his voice.)

1271
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,270
(He throws himself into the song with his eyes, nose and lips.)

1272
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:19,830
(You have to close your eyes while singing RnB.)

1273
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:24,000
(He's grooving to the music)

1274
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:27,500
(He's completely full of himself.)

1275
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,100
Hold on.

1276
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,070
Hold on. What's going on?

1277
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,430
I was going to add the next song to the playlist.

1278
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:41,470
- I pushed the wrong button.
 -  That's so rude.

1279
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:43,830
- It was an accident.
 -  I was doing really well.

1280
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:45,900
- I made a mistake.
 -  I get 100 points then.

1281
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,400
I pushed the wrong button by accident.

1282
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,820
- I cancelled it.
 -  I got 100 points.

1283
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:49,860
- What?
 -  I got 100 points.

1284
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,800
No, you have to start over.

1285
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,290
(My song was flawless.)

1286
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:54,980
Is this your way of winning?

1287
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,280
No.

1288
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,400
Next.

1289
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,800
(Now it's Kian84's turn.)

1290
00:50:58,800 --> 00:50:59,900
It's been a while since I sang this.

1291
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:02,110
I'll give it a go.

1292
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:03,130
- Here I go.
 -  Applause.

1293
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,830
(Taesaja in the house)

1294
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:10,120
("Way" by Taesaja was released in 1997.)

1295
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,170
You're a good rapper.

1296
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:12,770
(You have to be in your 30s to know this song.)

1297
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,800
(The breathless rapping is the key point of the song.)

1298
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:18,470
(He starts singing after the rap.)

1299
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:20,930
(He can't catch his breath.)

1300
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:24,000
(I live in the hottest house in the world.)

1301
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:27,670
(So I'll have refreshing dreams.)

1302
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,370
(He practised his vibe since 1997.)

1303
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:35,700
(I say)

1304
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,300
(Yes)

1305
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,290
That was your best song so far.

1306
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:42,660
- Was it all right?
 -  It was the best so far.

1307
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,070
You got 100 points.

1308
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:45,300
(He scored 100 points.)

1309
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:49,200
(He started laughing out loud.)

1310
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,300
- I'm in trouble.
 -  You just need to sing loudly.

1311
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:53,530
Then...

1312
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,140
(This song isn't sung when it's all just men.)

1313
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,230
It's "Cheer Up".

1314
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:00,230
(In order to sleep in a cool room,)

1315
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:03,070
(he starts off with a cute dance.)

1316
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:05,430
(Kian84 ignores him while searching for his next song.)

1317
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,470
(It's embarrassing.)

1318
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:11,830
(Cheer up, baby)

1319
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:14,600
(He's a childishly cheerful 40-year-old.)

1320
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,000
(Men can't lose a wager.)

1321
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:19,930
(I'll like myself better that way.)

1322
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,000
(Even if I lose, I'll act like I don't care.)

1323
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,800
(As if nothing matters)

1324
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,400
(He's twice as old as Twice.)

1325
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:31,800
(However, he forgets his age and sings his heart out.)

1326
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:33,700
(Did you see that?)

1327
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,700
That was great.

1328
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:38,130
You did great, Hyun Moo.

1329
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,000
- Look.
 -  What's that?

1330
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,030
The machine is weird.

1331
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:43,800
This is your neighbourhood.

1332
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,530
Hold on.

1333
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,130
(Kian84 changes things up for his next move.)

1334
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:53,120
(He sings about men's life.)

1335
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,370
A high note is coming up.

1336
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:56,200
(No one knows what will come next)

1337
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:59,300
(It's no fun if you win easily)

1338
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:02,870
(His low voice eases suffering.)

1339
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,900
(While he sings about life's struggles,)

1340
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,130
(Hyun Moo bursts out laughing.)

1341
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:09,830
(Screaming)

1342
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:14,170
(It ends with shouts and laughter.)

1343
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:17,870
(Men love emotional ballads.)

1344
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,920
(When you close your eyes,)

1345
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,430
(you remember your past lovers.)

1346
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:27,770
(How did the story of my life become a song?)

1347
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:30,100
(Today,)

1348
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:34,800
(he sings in sorrow while in slippers.)

1349
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,000
(They're the stars of a romance movie.)

1350
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:44,230
(Singing about love in spite of a clenched throat)

1351
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:47,630
(He keeps looking for his next song.)

1352
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:50,070
It's been so long since I've sung at a karaoke.

1353
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:53,200
- A ballad?
 -  What's the song I always sing?

1354
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:55,570
What's the song I always sing?

1355
00:53:58,370 --> 00:53:59,680
Did the power go out?

1356
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,460
This has never happened before.

1357
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:02,570
(The power went out at the karaoke.)

1358
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:03,830
Is it because of the air conditioner?

1359
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,670
They must have used too much electricity.

1360
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:08,230
The other rooms are dark, too.

1361
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,730
- Let's go.
 -  We can't sing without electricity.

1362
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,400
That's too bad. I wanted to sing one more.

1363
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:16,420
- That was fun.
 -  I had fun, too.

1364
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,700
It's so dark.

1365
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,230
(It's now late.)

1366
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,200
(They return home, exhausted from having too much fun.)

1367
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,290
Let's see.

1368
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:28,300
Look.

1369
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,300
(The air conditioner was installed.)

1370
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:32,200
I should've done this a long time ago.

1371
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:35,160
Why was I only using the fan for so long?

1372
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,230
You have an air conditioner now.

1373
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:38,670
What a beautiful sound.

1374
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:40,930
(This sound will relieve the heat.)

1375
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:42,780
The air conditioner is on.

1376
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:43,900
It's so powerful.

1377
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,100
I'll sleep standing up.

1378
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:48,670
I should've bought an air conditioner a long time ago.

1379
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:51,760
- This is so great.
 -  It's really cool.

1380
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,110
- It's great.
 -  You know I won, right?

1381
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:55,610
- All right.
 -  All right.

1382
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:56,730
Go sleep inside.

1383
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,430
- Right now?
 -  Hurry up.

1384
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:01,470
Do I have to go in?

1385
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:02,670
It's not cool inside, right?

1386
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:04,700
It's hot in here.

1387
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:05,800
It's not cool.

1388
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,400
The floor won't be sticky any more.

1389
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,100
I'll spread the blankets for you.

1390
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,270
Is that new?

1391
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:14,600
It's for you.

1392
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,470
Really? Thank you. That's new.

1393
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,300
I'll use an old one.

1394
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,600
It's brand new.

1395
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,930
(That's very thoughtful of you.)

1396
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:23,930
- Is this all you need?
 -  That's all I need.

1397
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:26,370
What's that?

1398
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,830
- Is that a comforter?
 -  Is this a sheet?

1399
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:30,270
(Is this a sheet?)

1400
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:33,020
You want me to use this as a blanket?

1401
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:35,020
- It's a sheet.
 -  This is a bed sheet.

1402
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:37,530
- I thought it was a blanket.
 -  Should I slide inside?

1403
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:40,370
Is that a sleeping bag?

1404
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,470
- Why did I get this?
 -  What's this?

1405
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,070
You ordered the wrong thing.

1406
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:47,870
Let's just flip it over.

1407
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,250
- Just turn it over.
 -  Why do you keep flipping things?

1408
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:52,470
This works.

1409
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:53,530
It's not bad.

1410
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:56,770
Lie down here?

1411
00:55:57,570 --> 00:55:59,120
Shouldn't you return it?

1412
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,380
Just use it.

1413
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:01,730
It's still a piece of fabric.

1414
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:03,970
- It's too much work to return it.
 -  All right.

1415
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,530
- You can use that.
 -  I don't need it.

1416
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:07,600
You only have a thick blanket.

1417
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,490
I got this for you.

1418
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:11,130
- It's for you.
 -  Really?

1419
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:12,600
It's new.

1420
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,400
I bought it since you were coming over.

1421
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,930
- Lay down on it.
 -  I'm like your grandfather.

1422
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:19,930
I'll get you a pillow.

1423
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:21,300
Here you go.

1424
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:24,700
Are you going to sleep?

1425
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:27,090
Do you want to drink?

1426
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:28,570
- You want to drink?
 -  Let's drink.

1427
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:30,630
Let's have a beer.

1428
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,360
- A beer?
 -  Yes.

1429
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,270
I snore after I drink beer.

1430
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:35,900
- You snore?
 -  Yes.

1431
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,500
Let's not drink, then.

1432
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:39,130
Don't drink.

1433
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,970
Why don't you go inside?

1434
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:44,730
I'm going to bed a little later.

1435
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:46,570
- Just sleep here.
 -  What?

1436
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:48,030
Let's sleep together.

1437
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,910
- I bought all of that.
 -  Just sleep here.

1438
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:53,370
How can I sleep next to a man?

1439
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:55,300
- It's hot.
 -  Right.

1440
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:57,030
Sleeping on the floor is best.

1441
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:00,300
Goodness.

1442
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:02,270
- This is great.
 -  Seriously.

1443
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,930
(He starts shifting position.)

1444
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:08,700
Do you want to watch a movie?

1445
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,300
- A movie?
 -  I can't sleep.

1446
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:12,220
All right.

1447
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,370
(They turn the TV on.)

1448
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:15,900
- Like this.
 -  Why is that on TV...

1449
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,950
when the two of us are alone?

1450
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:19,400
Lie down.

1451
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,790
- Kian84.
 -  What?

1452
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:22,430
I'll just sit up.

1453
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:25,200
That's great.

1454
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,900
(They found a new way to overcome the hot night.)

1455
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,400
Wow.

1456
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:32,100
It's the original imported version.

1457
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:34,400
(Is the air conditioner off? It's getting hot again.)

1458
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:37,370
- Let's watch something else.
 -  All right.

1459
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:39,670
You're shy.

1460
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:43,370
(They change the channel.)

1461
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:44,870
(Again?)

1462
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:46,840
- Sorry, I didn't do it on purpose.
 -  Right.

1463
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,410
Why are they selling so much underwear?

1464
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:49,970
It must sell well.

1465
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:52,670
I wish they sold my comic books on TV.

1466
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:55,730
That's amazing.

1467
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,300
(Goodness)

1468
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:02,700
I keep watching even though I have no intention of buying.

1469
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:04,400
- Let's watch something else.
 -  Why?

1470
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:06,100
Is this fun?

1471
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:07,570
- Don't you like it?
 -  Why are you watching this?

1472
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:08,800
You're not going to buy it.

1473
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:10,430
It's Friday after all.

1474
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:11,670
There's nothing to watch.

1475
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,300
Since I live alone,

1476
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:17,100
it's been a while...

1477
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:20,000
since I opened up to someone.

1478
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,870
It's been a while since I've lied down and chatted with someone.

1479
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:25,470
It felt really strange.

1480
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:28,230
When I was younger,

1481
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:30,970
we used to lie around like that...

1482
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:35,130
when relatives came over to visit.

1483
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:37,180
It reminded me of that.

1484
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,300
There's Dong Hyun.

1485
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,600
Dong Hyun threw a punch.

1486
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:42,570
That's it.

1487
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:43,670
(He's immersed in Dong Hyun's match.)

1488
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:44,700
That's right.

1489
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,570
Are you close friends?

1490
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,810
- We're close.
 -  Really?

1491
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:51,720
I was in a Muay Thai match before.

1492
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:52,960
- Really?
 -  Yes.

1493
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,300
I used to go to the gym for two months.

1494
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:55,860
They wanted me to compete.

1495
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:58,630
They said I would do well.

1496
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:00,610
I agreed.

1497
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:03,040
My opponent looked easy.

1498
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,070
I thought I'd win easily.

1499
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:07,500
But he was on another level.

1500
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,500
I got beaten up.

1501
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,270
I started working hard on my comics then.

1502
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:14,430
- You gave up Muay Thai?
 -  Yes.

1503
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,630
(It's been an amazing day due to the heat.)

1504
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:20,390
It's so cool.

1505
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,130
- It's best at home.
 -  Well...

1506
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:25,870
We bought a lot. I can stay for a few days, Hye Jin.

1507
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,130
Right?

1508
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:33,670
(The abundance of food makes her happy.)

1509
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,830
I'll make you carbonara tteokbokki.

1510
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:37,300
- Carbonara?
 -  Yes.

1511
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:41,630
I don't have any decent cooking utensils.

1512
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,630
Is this okay?

1513
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:47,450
The mushrooms alone won't fit in that.

1514
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:48,600
Are you joking?

1515
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,670
You can tell that I live alone, right?

1516
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,670
That's for frying a single egg.

1517
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:55,670
- Are you kidding?
 -  The biggest pan...

1518
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:58,670
- I have is this one.
 -  You have one.

1519
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:00,830
- I only have this.
 -  That can work.

1520
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,160
I only have a frying pan.

1521
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,670
That's fine.

1522
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,070
I'm excited.

1523
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:07,830
- I'll begin.
 -  All right.

1524
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,470
(She starts to cook like an expert.)

1525
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:14,490
When do you add the cream?

1526
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:17,280
When the rice cake is cooked,

1527
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,930
add milk and cheese.

1528
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:23,470
You add milk and cheese instead of cream?

1529
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:24,900
(She's a great cook who only needs milk.)

1530
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:27,400
I'll get the milk.

1531
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:31,970
(A cheap yet elegant dish for Hye Jin)

1532
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:34,300
We can add the milk now.

1533
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,190
(She adds a generous amount of milk.)

1534
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:40,200
- Isn't that too much?
 -  It'll reduce.

1535
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:44,200
- Isn't the colour great?
 -  It's great.

1536
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,630
- It looks like cream sauce.
 -  Right.

1537
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:49,470
My mouth is watering.

1538
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:53,770
You already lost.

1539
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:56,900
That's no joke.

1540
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,570
It's carbonara and bokbunja ju.

1541
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:01,870
This is seriously no joke.

1542
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:03,600
(Hye Jin is preparing ramyeon to go with it.)

1543
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:04,900
We need some soup.

1544
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:06,700
I like to add garlic.

1545
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:11,570
(Wow)

1546
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:14,870
(Hye Jin only adds two-thirds of the noodles.)

1547
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,070
(Gook Ju is unaware while she tastes the tteokbokki.)

1548
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:22,830
Yum.

1549
01:01:22,830 --> 01:01:24,060
I'll add half of the soup base.

1550
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:25,570
(She only adds half to reduce sodium intake.)

1551
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:27,740
Wow.

1552
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:29,800
- Milk makes you bloat less.
 -  That's right.

1553
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,400
- If you eat salty food...
 -  You'll get bloated.

1554
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:35,270
I'll add the cheese, too.

1555
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:36,430
(Gook Ju keeps eating while the ramyeon cooks.)

1556
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,630
(Yum)

1557
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,100
(They're both standing while they eat.)

1558
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:44,200
(Yum)

1559
01:01:45,930 --> 01:01:47,270
(Yum)

1560
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,200
(Yum)

1561
01:01:49,930 --> 01:01:51,730
(Yum)

1562
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:53,400
- Yum.
 -  It's good.

1563
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:55,300
(They're able to communicate without any words.)

1564
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,170
This is amazing.

1565
01:01:57,870 --> 01:01:59,100
Why did you only use half of the noodles?

1566
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:00,820
No, it's two-thirds.

1567
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:02,870
Why didn't you add all of it?

1568
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:05,200
I don't understand you, Hye Jin.

1569
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,170
- How annoying.
 -  Let's go.

1570
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:10,200
Why didn't you cook it all?

1571
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,830
No wonder the portion looked too small.

1572
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,100
(The model's ramyeon is lacking.)

1573
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:20,490
(The expert cook's tteokbokki is generous.)

1574
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:22,670
- This is great.
 -  I'll start with the ramyeon.

1575
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:25,590
We're supposed to share that.

1576
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:27,000
- What?
 -  It's for both of us.

1577
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,530
You didn't even cook everything.

1578
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:32,500
I can finish it in two bites.

1579
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:36,100
I hate sharing noodles.

1580
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:37,630
Why?

1581
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:39,970
It's never enough.

1582
01:02:39,970 --> 01:02:41,780
- That's good.
 -  No, it isn't.

1583
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:45,370
I like it when the noodles hit my cheek as I slurp them.

1584
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:46,700
- Like this?
 -  Of course.

1585
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:49,900
(She slurps angrily.)

1586
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:53,300
It's really good.

1587
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:56,500
(They're happily eating together.)

1588
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:02,070
(She drinks milk because the ramyeon is spicy.)

1589
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,810
You're a great cook.

1590
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:11,430
You could open a restaurant.

1591
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:13,530
You could charge 35 dollars in Cheongdam-dong.

1592
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,500
(She's satisfied with the food.)

1593
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:19,500
(They're happy just eating.)

1594
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:22,050
Eating this...

1595
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:23,590
makes me think of sundaeguk.

1596
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:26,280
What's with you? Go home.

1597
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,360
When are you leaving? It's past 10pm.

1598
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:30,300
I like it here.

1599
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:33,210
The sofa fits me perfectly.

1600
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:35,570
I look better in this house than you do.

1601
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:40,930
(They finally finish eating.)

1602
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:43,600
(She's tired.)

1603
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,670
(She's exhausted from eating all day.)

1604
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:50,000
There's a difference between us.

1605
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,070
- What?
 -  We're both full.

1606
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:54,200
But you moved over there.

1607
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,230
I'm still in the same spot.

1608
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:58,430
That's why we look different.

1609
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:00,800
You have to move after eating.

1610
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:03,540
Not yet.

1611
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:04,930
- Not yet?
 -  No.

1612
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:08,180
You need something in common to get along with someone.

1613
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:10,820
As I get older, it isn't easy...

1614
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:13,720
to find a friend I get along with.

1615
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:18,970
I relieved a lot of stress today. It was great.

1616
01:04:18,970 --> 01:04:23,030
I hope we can meet often to eat and chat together.

1617
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:25,430
It's the first time...

1618
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:29,770
anyone has come to hang out with me.

1619
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:32,930
It's the first time after I moved here.

1620
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:37,130
Gook Ju threw a rock...

1621
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:40,900
into my placid life.

1622
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:45,170
I'll probably be lonely for a while.

1623
01:04:45,830 --> 01:04:49,140
This is nice. After 30 minutes,

1624
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:50,770
let's order some eel.

1625
01:04:51,830 --> 01:04:54,670
I digested the tteokbokki already.

1626
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,700
Aren't you leaving?

1627
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,300
I really like it here.

1628
01:04:58,630 --> 01:04:59,830
This is fun.

1629
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:00,970
(It's so fun here.)

1630
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:04,870
I want to eat more, Hye Jin.

1631
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:06,670
(It was a busy and fun day.)

1632
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:09,900
(Chae A is at a gym in Ilsan.)

1633
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:12,230
Is this it?

1634
01:05:12,970 --> 01:05:17,300
(Chae A is very much excited.)

1635
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,300
(Agile)

1636
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,030
Hello.

1637
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:26,180
- Hello.
 -  Hello.

1638
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:27,860
- Are you the director?
 -  Yes.

1639
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:29,200
- Yes.
 -  Hello.

1640
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:31,610
- It's nice to meet you.
 -  Yes.

1641
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:34,130
I'm going to be in a movie.

1642
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:37,080
I'm playing a special agent.

1643
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,700
Since I'm a special agent,

1644
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:44,240
I have to do action scenes.

1645
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:48,670
It's my first day learning martial arts at the action school.

1646
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:54,570
I want the action scenes to be realistic.

1647
01:05:54,570 --> 01:05:59,510
The genre of the film is action comedy.

1648
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:02,170
- But the action...
 -  I want it to be realistic.

1649
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:03,760
- I want it to be really realistic.
 -  Right.

1650
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:08,200
I play a detective, so I want it to be great.

1651
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,270
- Let's have a plan.
 -  All right.

1652
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:12,870
- We'll practise according to that.
 -  Right.

1653
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:14,970
Please follow along.

1654
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:16,390
I'll do my best.

1655
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:19,850
- Let's start with kicks.
 -  All right.

1656
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:22,800
(Actor who will appear with Chae A in the action scene)

1657
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:26,770
(He demonstrates the kick first.)

1658
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:28,200
Director?

1659
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:30,230
(He shows quickness.)

1660
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:32,630
(His kick is powerful.)

1661
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,030
I'm scared.

1662
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:37,130
- Get ready.
 -  All right.

1663
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:39,270
It needs to be powerful so you'd need to shout.

1664
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:40,800
(Will Chae A do well?)

1665
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:42,370
That's it.

1666
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:44,930
(She turns after kicking.)

1667
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:47,270
- The reason why you're dizzy is...
 -  Yes?

1668
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:49,230
that people kick with...

1669
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:52,500
all their strength. Then it's hard to turn.

1670
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,300
A person's centre of balance is in their head.

1671
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:56,540
Turn your head first after kicking.

1672
01:06:56,540 --> 01:07:00,730
If I lose balance after kicking hard...

1673
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,700
(His shoe tore.)

1674
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:04,520
- This is bad.
 -  It tore?

1675
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,870
My shoe tore.

1676
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:08,730
(He feels embarrassed.)

1677
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:10,130
- Director.
 -  Sorry.

1678
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:14,700
Your power was too overwhelming.

1679
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,370
(She clasps her hands politely.)

1680
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:18,500
Goodness.

1681
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:19,870
(What will happen to me?)

1682
01:07:20,530 --> 01:07:22,270
(The director smiles brightly.)

1683
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:24,470
- Kick here?
 -  Yes.

1684
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,170
- Here I go.
 -  All right.

1685
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:29,500
Take it slow.

1686
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:32,730
That's it. Great, great.

1687
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:36,100
Look at the opponent and shoot lasers at him.

1688
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:37,670
Shoot lasers. That's it.

1689
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:41,050
Laser. That's it.

1690
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:43,300
- Maintain your balance.
 -  All right.

1691
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:46,300
Many female actors do this kick.

1692
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:50,070
It's the best type of kick to show off flexibility.

1693
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:54,430
That's it.

1694
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:55,850
That was the best so far.

1695
01:07:55,850 --> 01:07:58,270
That was the best kick you've ever done.

1696
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:00,200
Keep your eyes on your opponent.

1697
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:02,630
That's it. Use your other leg.

1698
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,000
(His compliments make her feel more confident.)

1699
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:08,800
(Her knee kicks are praised as well.)

1700
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,170
- One more time.
 -  All right.

1701
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:11,830
Go for it.

1702
01:08:12,770 --> 01:08:16,500
I can do whatever is asked of me.

1703
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:18,470
(I can do whatever is asked of me.)

1704
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:22,680
I enjoy boxing.

1705
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:25,050
I think that helped a lot.

1706
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:28,030
From time to time,

1707
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:31,560
I worry about the difficult action sequences.

1708
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:34,680
However, the director kept complimenting me.

1709
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:37,090
It made me want to do better.

1710
01:08:37,090 --> 01:08:39,570
It made me passionate about the action scenes.

1711
01:08:40,030 --> 01:08:43,960
There are acrobatic scenes in the movie.

1712
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:45,160
- Acrobatics?
 -  Yes.

1713
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,990
Many martial artists are unable to do acrobatics.

1714
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:51,900
- We'll start with basic rolling.
 -  All right.

1715
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:54,300
If I do that,

1716
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:55,370
- the scene will be big.
 -  Right.

1717
01:08:55,370 --> 01:08:57,670
They can widen the shot.

1718
01:08:57,670 --> 01:09:00,270
After the basics,

1719
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:02,650
- let's keep going if you can.
 -  All right.

1720
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:05,440
This is one of the most common moves.

1721
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:08,170
It shows off a woman's figure.

1722
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:11,200
It's an acrobatic move called an aerial cartwheel.

1723
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:14,570
(He demonstrates the aerial cartwheel.)

1724
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,270
Another common move is a back handspring.

1725
01:09:19,270 --> 01:09:21,030
(This time, it's a back handspring.)

1726
01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:26,970
This is the most difficult move.

1727
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:29,390
- Take a look.
 -  Be careful.

1728
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:32,270
(After the back handsprings, a turn in mid-air)

1729
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:34,800
Can you do it?

1730
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:36,570
Do I have to?

1731
01:09:36,570 --> 01:09:39,100
Those moves are really difficult.

1732
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:40,470
I think it'll be so scary.

1733
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:42,490
- This one is also...
 -  I can't even start.

1734
01:09:42,490 --> 01:09:44,620
We'll make sure that you're safe.

1735
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:46,390
- Try it slowly.
 -  I think it'll make me dizzy.

1736
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:47,500
I will be very dizzy.

1737
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,300
(She'll start out slowly with rolling on the mat.)

1738
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:51,270
- How do I do it?
 -  Sit down first.

1739
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:52,370
- From sitting down like this?
 -  Yes.

1740
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:54,730
Hold your knees and get up. Yes, that's it!

1741
01:09:54,730 --> 01:09:55,900
(That's it!)

1742
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:58,770
(That encouraged her to keep doing it.)

1743
01:09:58,770 --> 01:10:00,500
Stop. You can stop now.

1744
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:02,530
Gosh, I'm so dizzy.

1745
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:04,900
- You did so well.
 -  Did I?

1746
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:06,100
You did such a great job.

1747
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:08,370
I'm dizzy.

1748
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,720
Now, let's try rolling backwards.

1749
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,180
- Rolling backwards?
 -  Yes.

1750
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:12,470
- Sit down here first.
 -  Is that how I start?

1751
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:13,570
Yes, you have to sit down first.

1752
01:10:13,570 --> 01:10:15,150
In 1, 2 and 3!

1753
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:17,150
Push! That's it!

1754
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:18,700
Where am I?

1755
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:19,900
(The entire world is spinning.)

1756
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:22,200
- Where am I right now?
 -  You did well.

1757
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:24,990
That's it! Yes.

1758
01:10:24,990 --> 01:10:26,300
Great. That was awesome.

1759
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:28,540
When is this needed by the way?

1760
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:30,460
Why would I need this for action scenes?

1761
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:32,920
- This is necessary...
 -  Will I ever use this?

1762
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,790
for you to move on to the next step.

1763
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:36,290
- We just practised rolling.
 -  Yes.

1764
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:38,190
Let's use acrobatic moves like that...

1765
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:40,830
to try learning a few things you can use for action scenes.

1766
01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:41,870
- Sure.
 -  All right.

1767
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:45,130
(First, fight according to the choreography.)

1768
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:47,600
(Second, use the rolling move.)

1769
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:51,300
- Your back must touch the surface.
 -  It's higher than I expected.

1770
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:52,300
(Will she be able to do this, too?)

1771
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:56,110
- Yes. That's it!
 -  Roll on your back!

1772
01:10:56,110 --> 01:10:57,370
- Impressive.
 -  That was awesome.

1773
01:10:57,370 --> 01:10:58,570
(They cheer her on.)

1774
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:00,760
You can do this...

1775
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,800
because you're not scared.

1776
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,630
It's not something you can do when you're scared.

1777
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:06,490
It's...

1778
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:08,290
- seriously...
 -  Did I do a good job?

1779
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:09,770
- Yes.
 -  I don't really know what happened.

1780
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:11,530
You don't, right? But you did great.

1781
01:11:11,530 --> 01:11:13,130
- Let's try one more time.
 -  Sure.

1782
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:15,000
All right. Ready...

1783
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,130
(She's so nimble.)

1784
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,070
Perfect! That was perfect.

1785
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:20,100
- Nicely done.
 -  Gosh, it hurts.

1786
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:24,860
You actually have to wear knee and elbow pads for this,

1787
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:27,270
- but this is a demonstration, so...
 -  By the way,

1788
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:29,660
- if there's a villain here...
 -  You must kick him.

1789
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:31,480
Can't I just come around...

1790
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,200
and kick him like this?

1791
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:37,440
Do I really have to roll like this before kicking him?

1792
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:39,570
(You have a point.)

1793
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:42,560
Most practical people like me would...

1794
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:43,850
- You're right.
 -  go up to the villain...

1795
01:11:43,850 --> 01:11:44,940
and kick him like this.

1796
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:46,600
There's a huge gap between movies and reality.

1797
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,040
It's very different.

1798
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:49,470
(Now, I can understand.)

1799
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:52,620
After this, we'll create a scenario and connect the moves.

1800
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:54,170
That's why you're learning these moves.

1801
01:11:54,170 --> 01:11:56,730
If you can do these moves... We call it "choreography".

1802
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:59,690
You'll learn the choreography and use these moves in it.

1803
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:01,810
- Let's give it a try.
 -  Okay.

1804
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:03,700
We'll try a simple choreography with two main moves.

1805
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:04,800
(Action actors will demonstrate first.)

1806
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:09,670
(Beat the first villain.)

1807
01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:11,200
(Then beat the second one.)

1808
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,440
Then you roll.

1809
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:14,090
Let's go.

1810
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:15,300
(Chae A confronts two villains.)

1811
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:16,400
Get ready...

1812
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:17,830
and go!

1813
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:18,830
(She's serious.)

1814
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:21,790
(She quickly beats both villains...)

1815
01:12:21,790 --> 01:12:22,900
(and rolls...)

1816
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:24,570
(to attack an innocent civilian as well.)

1817
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:26,830
Great. That was really good.

1818
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,370
- Aren't you over-complimenting me?
 -  You're so fearless.

1819
01:12:29,370 --> 01:12:32,200
No, you're really good at this. You make me want to teach you more.

1820
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,290
Let's learn one more move, then.

1821
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:37,270
I was going to make you practise a lot before teaching you this,

1822
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:38,680
- I see.
 -  but you're learning so fast.

1823
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:39,730
I think I'll be...

1824
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,700
- good at everything.
 -  All right.

1825
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:44,130
- Then let's get ready to move on.
 -  I feel so confident right now.

1826
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:47,070
Please demonstrate the move using the neck.

1827
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:48,130
Ready,

1828
01:12:48,940 --> 01:12:49,940
action.

1829
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:53,300
(Fly like a bee...)

1830
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:55,000
(and wrap your legs around your opponent's neck.)

1831
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:59,290
- This one will be very difficult.
 -  It is, indeed.

1832
01:12:59,290 --> 01:13:01,400
I'm not kidding. It's one of the most difficult moves.

1833
01:13:01,730 --> 01:13:03,820
If you can pull this off,

1834
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:05,940
you won't need a stand-in for action scenes.

1835
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:08,290
Let's give it a try. I'll strongly recommend you...

1836
01:13:08,290 --> 01:13:09,700
to all film directors if you can do this.

1837
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:12,490
Let's try wrapping your leg around his neck first.

1838
01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:13,800
- Okay.
 -  Just that part.

1839
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:14,800
Get ready.

1840
01:13:15,370 --> 01:13:17,730
In 1, 2 and 3!

1841
01:13:18,370 --> 01:13:19,490
Great! That's it.

1842
01:13:19,490 --> 01:13:21,190
- Twist your legs.
 -  Turn your body...

1843
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:22,770
Yes. Wrap both legs around his neck to...

1844
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:25,060
That's it! You're doing great. I think you'll be able to do it.

1845
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:26,100
Don't you think so?

1846
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:31,020
Let's try it. I'll help you like just now, so let's...

1847
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:32,760
give it a try. Do it slowly.

1848
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,700
Think of this as a real shoot. Get ready.

1849
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:36,820
Be serious.

1850
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:38,150
Ready,

1851
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:39,370
action!

1852
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,130
I'm going to kill you all.

1853
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:59,160
(They're impressed.)

1854
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:00,530
We're so impressed.

1855
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:03,160
You seriously won't need a stand-in.

1856
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:05,070
I really mean it. I'm not lying.

1857
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:06,620
- I was going to use wires.
 -  Are you okay?

1858
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:07,670
Are you all right?

1859
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,890
I'm serious. I really think you can do it.

1860
01:14:10,890 --> 01:14:11,900
- Really?
 -  Yes.

1861
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:14,410
- It was fun.
 -  You did such a great job.

1862
01:14:14,410 --> 01:14:15,530
- Thank you.
 -  I'm impressed.

1863
01:14:15,530 --> 01:14:16,830
You surprised me.

1864
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:18,920
He said that I'd be able...

1865
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:23,170
to shoot action scenes without the need for a stand-in.

1866
01:14:23,570 --> 01:14:25,250
Hearing that...

1867
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:26,710
was such a proud moment.

1868
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:30,560
I'm quite ambitious, so I want to do everything myself...

1869
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:35,030
without a stand-in. He said that it's definitely possible,

1870
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:39,000
so that alone made today a great day.

1871
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:41,470
Soon Shim.

1872
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:43,630
Did you have a good day?

1873
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:45,200
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

1874
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:46,530
(She says hi to Soon Shim first.)

1875
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:47,530
Goodness, I'm so tired.

1876
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:48,940
(Then she heads over to her couch right away.)

1877
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,530
Do you know what I did today?

1878
01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:53,170
Today,

1879
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:55,100
I learned...

1880
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:57,370
amazing combat moves for action scenes.

1881
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,970
You'd never imagine me doing those moves.

1882
01:14:59,970 --> 01:15:01,200
Come over here, Soon Shim.

1883
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:06,400
(Let me practise a move, too.)

1884
01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:08,570
I'm exhausted. My body aches, too.

1885
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:10,970
(Come at me!)

1886
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:13,770
Shall I put on the pain relieving patch?

1887
01:15:14,770 --> 01:15:16,130
(She grabs a pain relieving patch.)

1888
01:15:16,130 --> 01:15:17,130
I found one.

1889
01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:19,270
How am I going to put this on?

1890
01:15:20,370 --> 01:15:22,100
Soon Shim, put this on my back.

1891
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:25,370
How am I going to do this by myself?

1892
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:27,170
What should I do?

1893
01:15:27,170 --> 01:15:28,600
(She gets up to find a solution.)

1894
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:33,730
(She tries to use the mirror,)

1895
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:34,970
(but her attempt fails.)

1896
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:37,830
I should put it right here.

1897
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:39,590
This is a great idea.

1898
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:42,370
I came up with an ingenious idea.

1899
01:15:42,770 --> 01:15:43,900
This is why great things...

1900
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:45,300
(This is why great things...)

1901
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:46,400
often come from desperation.

1902
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,400
(Desperation can be a good thing.)

1903
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,270
It's right here.

1904
01:15:51,230 --> 01:15:52,270
I got it.

1905
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:54,130
I did it.

1906
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:55,410
(Did she succeed without Soon Shim's help?)

1907
01:15:55,410 --> 01:15:56,570
Gosh, how can I fix this?

1908
01:15:59,570 --> 01:16:00,630
Oh, right. I should...

1909
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:02,700
(She came up with another idea.)

1910
01:16:05,130 --> 01:16:06,300
Goodness, I'm in pain.

1911
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:07,500
Soon Shim, you startled me.

1912
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:08,530
(You startled me.)

1913
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:11,460
(She took out a back scratcher.)

1914
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:12,870
That worked. I got it right on the spot.

1915
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:14,000
(This is why people need tools.)

1916
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:18,970
Putting on the patch exhausted me even more.

1917
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:22,100
Soon Shim, it'd be amazing if you could do things like this for me.

1918
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:24,370
Don't you think so?

1919
01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:28,570
(I need to lie down.)

1920
01:16:28,570 --> 01:16:29,600
Soon Shim.

1921
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:32,600
I'm hungry because I exercised intensely today.

1922
01:16:34,830 --> 01:16:37,670
What shall I eat?

1923
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,470
Shall I get fried chicken and beer...

1924
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:42,280
just for today?

1925
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:43,440
Just today.

1926
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:46,200
All right, I won't.

1927
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:50,130
Soybean broth...

1928
01:16:50,530 --> 01:16:52,130
How many calories does a bowl of kongguksu have?

1929
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:53,940
Let's eat kongguksu.

1930
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:55,030
(Let's eat kongguksu.)

1931
01:16:55,030 --> 01:16:56,070
Soon Shim.

1932
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,100
Make me a bowl of kongguksu.

1933
01:16:58,100 --> 01:17:00,150
(Soon Shim, make me a bowl of kongguksu.)

1934
01:17:00,150 --> 01:17:04,370
I tend to be very strict when I have to get ready...

1935
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:06,850
for film or drama shoots.

1936
01:17:06,850 --> 01:17:10,010
Once, I didn't eat anything...

1937
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:12,470
for about 5 to 7 days... prior to a shoot.

1938
01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:17,300
I am very strict about what I eat and losing weight.

1939
01:17:17,970 --> 01:17:20,530
Let's make kongguksu now.

1940
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:22,500
I need one block of tofu...

1941
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,970
and a handful of almonds.

1942
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:26,470
While grinding them together,

1943
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,170
I'll take agar-agar out.

1944
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:31,700
Agar-agar strips.

1945
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:34,000
I heard this has zero calories.

1946
01:17:35,770 --> 01:17:37,830
(Rinse agar-agar strips.)

1947
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:39,140
I'll leave the strips to drain.

1948
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:40,170
This is ready.

1949
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:42,300
(Sniffing)

1950
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:45,830
It doesn't smell that delicious.

1951
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:50,130
(Put blended tofu and agar-agar strips in a bowl.)

1952
01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:52,770
(Then add cucumber slices as garnish...)

1953
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:54,570
(and sprinkle sesame seeds.)

1954
01:17:56,170 --> 01:17:58,600
(No dish is complete before you take a photo of it.)

1955
01:17:58,600 --> 01:17:59,730
It looks absolutely delicious.

1956
01:17:59,730 --> 01:18:01,800
(Agar-agar is great for those who are looking to lose weight.)

1957
01:18:03,670 --> 01:18:06,000
(Her low-calorie kongguksu looks nutty and tasty.)

1958
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:10,530
(Slurping)

1959
01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:13,700
(She tastes the soup, too.)

1960
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:15,730
(Is it delicious?)

1961
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:18,140
It tastes very healthy.

1962
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:20,530
I only had one bite so far, but I already want to stop eating it.

1963
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:21,900
(I don't want to eat this.)

1964
01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:25,200
Shall I add just a little bit of this?

1965
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,030
(Shall I sprinkle a bit of salt?)

1966
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:29,370
(She's torn.)

1967
01:18:33,070 --> 01:18:34,070
No.

1968
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:35,970
(She managed to resist the temptation.)

1969
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,080
Those who like soybeans would love this dish.

1970
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:40,130
It's great for those who like tofu.

1971
01:18:41,570 --> 01:18:43,700
(The problem is that I'm not one of them.)

1972
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:47,960
I got a lot of compliments today,

1973
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:50,230
so I feel super confident right now.

1974
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:54,700
(She studies the action scenes in the middle of eating.)

1975
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:56,800
I want to become a great action actor.

1976
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,230
(I want to become a great action actor.)

1977
01:19:00,730 --> 01:19:02,940
Soon Shim, does this mean I'll become...

1978
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:06,370
Angelina Jolie of Korea?

1979
01:19:07,370 --> 01:19:08,570
(She's embarrassed.)

1980
01:19:08,570 --> 01:19:09,700
Did I go too far?

1981
01:19:10,170 --> 01:19:12,370
If you had seen what I did today,

1982
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:14,300
you would've peed your pants.

1983
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:15,500
(You would've peed your pants.)

1984
01:19:16,370 --> 01:19:17,940
If you'd been there to see what I did...

1985
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:20,670
I got so many compliments today.

1986
01:19:21,130 --> 01:19:22,470
I really want to learn more.

1987
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:24,850
First,

1988
01:19:24,850 --> 01:19:27,230
I'll practise rolling, which I got complimented on.

1989
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:28,800
I'll roll on this.

1990
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:30,470
Here I go.

1991
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:33,830
Move over, Soon Shim. You'll get hurt.

1992
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:37,970
(We can see how passionate she is about acting.)

1993
01:19:39,170 --> 01:19:41,770
I've been cast for a film.

1994
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:43,470
It's my first film in about a year,

1995
01:19:43,870 --> 01:19:45,600
so there are many things that I need to prepare.

1996
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,570
I'll also have to pull many all-nighters for the shoots.

1997
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:51,800
Hence, I think I'll need to take a short break...

1998
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,830
from I Live Alone.

1999
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:58,100
I've decided to focus on the film for a while.

2000
01:19:59,470 --> 01:20:02,500
Through I live Alone, many people became interested...

2001
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,830
in my lifestyle, and I received so much support...

2002
01:20:04,830 --> 01:20:06,670
as well as love.

2003
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:09,440
When you live alone,

2004
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:13,970
opportunities to look back and reassess your life...

2005
01:20:13,970 --> 01:20:16,400
don't come by easily, and you rarely get to make such efforts.

2006
01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:18,820
This show, I Live Alone,

2007
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:22,630
gave me an opportunity to do just that.

2008
01:20:22,630 --> 01:20:26,440
I'm also glad that many people empathised with me...

2009
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:30,600
and loved me being on the show. I must say that I am...

2010
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:34,600
very grateful to have been a part of the show.

2011
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:41,800
I'll work harder as an actor...

2012
01:20:42,970 --> 01:20:47,230
to come back to show you the better, newer me.

2013
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:54,370
(Her cheery vibe and charisma...)

2014
01:20:54,370 --> 01:20:57,600
(will make her shine on the silver screen.)

2015
01:20:58,770 --> 01:20:59,870
What do you think?

2016
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:01,670
That was hard.

2017
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:03,130
I'm exhausted.

2018
01:21:03,130 --> 01:21:06,370
(Happy farewell with the action actor, Chae A)

2019
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:09,500
(At Kim Ban Jang's house on an exciting day)

2020
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,530
Make sure to include that and the tree in the frame.

2021
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:13,870
(His front yard is filled with filming equipment.)

2022
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:16,100
(There are so many people, too.)

2023
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:17,650
Yes. Bring it down from there.

2024
01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:19,700
(Where is Kim Ban Jang, though?)

2025
01:21:21,070 --> 01:21:23,300
(We love you so)

2026
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:26,100
I have to wear something that goes with the song.

2027
01:21:27,070 --> 01:21:28,570
(He puts it on the floor.)

2028
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:32,800
(He lays them out on the floor to decide what to wear today.)

2029
01:21:35,230 --> 01:21:36,810
We're shooting a music video today,

2030
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:39,030
and we decided to do it at my place.

2031
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:42,030
I moved here about six years ago,

2032
01:21:42,370 --> 01:21:45,250
and I've never had so many people over at once like this.

2033
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:48,300
I was thinking that it may look like a refugee camp.

2034
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,100
It was very hectic.

2035
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:53,170
(The current temperature is 36°C.)

2036
01:21:53,970 --> 01:21:57,630
(There is no air conditioning at his house.)

2037
01:21:59,370 --> 01:22:00,570
It's so hot, isn't it?

2038
01:22:00,570 --> 01:22:01,790
Yes.

2039
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:03,670
(The body heat from all the people makes it feel hotter.)

2040
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:05,400
(I should turn on the fan.)

2041
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,530
I don't even have an air conditioner.

2042
01:22:09,470 --> 01:22:10,730
I hope this cools you guys down.

2043
01:22:11,470 --> 01:22:13,270
I brought it from Hyun Moo's place yesterday.

2044
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,500
You must need the fan, no?

2045
01:22:15,870 --> 01:22:17,470
I'll give it to you if you need a fan.

2046
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:18,630
- Seriously?
 -  Yes.

2047
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:20,440
Thank you.

2048
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:23,770
(All right.)

2049
01:22:25,670 --> 01:22:28,200
(He's grabbing a few other things.)

2050
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:34,800
My place is very hot, isn't it? Do any of you need towels?

2051
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,300
- Yes, thank you.
 -  I'd love one.

2052
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:37,460
Sure.

2053
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:38,470
- Thank you.
 -  Well...

2054
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:39,600
- I'd like one, too.
 -  Here you go.

2055
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:40,900
- Thank you.
 -  You're welcome.

2056
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:42,200
- Can I get one, too?
 -  Of course.

2057
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:44,800
- A little bit more.
 -  You guys are working so hard.

2058
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,050
Thank you.

2059
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:47,300
Ban Jang, we need you in the frame.

2060
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:50,830
(The shoot begins.)

2061
01:22:50,830 --> 01:22:52,470
We're ready now.

2062
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:54,340
All right. Let's go.

2063
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:55,900
Okay. Everyone, get ready.

2064
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:57,490
Let's roll.

2065
01:22:57,490 --> 01:22:58,670
- Yes.
 -  Action!

2066
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:00,940
(That startled Ban Jang.)

2067
01:23:01,970 --> 01:23:03,000
(He starts singing.)

2068
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:04,730
(He misses the first beat...)

2069
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:06,230
(and sings lethargically.)

2070
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:10,870
(His face looks tense, too.)

2071
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,670
(It looks like today will be a long day.)

2072
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:15,520
Cut!

2073
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:16,870
- We'll take a short break.
 -  Cut.

2074
01:23:17,370 --> 01:23:20,440
You look too tense right now.

2075
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:23,100
- Please relax.
 -  Relax and do whatever you want.

2076
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:24,100
- Okay.
 -  Good.

2077
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:25,670
Everyone, let's go again. Get ready.

2078
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:26,900
(Second attempt at the solo scene)

2079
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:27,970
Action!

2080
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,600
(Go away.)

2081
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,030
(I need to relax.)

2082
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,030
(Forcing himself to relax makes him more nervous.)

2083
01:23:35,030 --> 01:23:36,210
Stop!

2084
01:23:36,210 --> 01:23:38,530
- You look very awkward right now.
 -  I see.

2085
01:23:38,530 --> 01:23:40,870
- You still seem tense.
 -  Do I?

2086
01:23:40,870 --> 01:23:43,540
- Okay.
 -  Your facial expressions...

2087
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:45,030
are making you look very lethargic.

2088
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:47,800
- Let's give it another try.
 -  Sure.

2089
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:48,830
All right.

2090
01:23:49,370 --> 01:23:52,400
(Grooving)

2091
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:54,300
(That's pretty good.)

2092
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:58,000
(His facial exercises seem to have worked.)

2093
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:00,630
(He uses his hat to add a witty twist to the end of the scene.)

2094
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:02,870
(He's finally feeling relaxed.)

2095
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:04,670
Cut! Okay!

2096
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:05,730
- That was good.
 -  Yes.

2097
01:24:05,730 --> 01:24:07,970
(After the morning portion of the shoot)

2098
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,470
(He rummages through something.)

2099
01:24:11,070 --> 01:24:12,300
They have to eat something.

2100
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:15,570
Goodness, I ran out of rice.

2101
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:17,770
I'm in trouble.

2102
01:24:17,770 --> 01:24:18,830
(I'm in trouble.)

2103
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:22,570
(Running)

2104
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,070
(Rushing)

2105
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:31,230
(He's running at full speed, carrying his pot as a baton.)

2106
01:24:33,070 --> 01:24:34,100
(He arrives at a restaurant nearby.)

2107
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:35,200
Hello, Sir.

2108
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:38,920
I have guests over now and realised that I've run out of rice.

2109
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:40,530
- I came to get some rice.
 -  All right.

2110
01:24:40,530 --> 01:24:42,370
- I'll pay you back.
 -  Shall I put it in this?

2111
01:24:42,370 --> 01:24:44,730
Yes, please. It's my pressure rice cooker.

2112
01:24:45,370 --> 01:24:47,270
(It's freshly cooked warm rice.)

2113
01:24:47,830 --> 01:24:49,270
I really appreciate it.

2114
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:50,300
Yes.

2115
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:51,850
- Thank you so much for this.
 -  No problem.

2116
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:52,900
Thank you again!

2117
01:24:53,370 --> 01:24:56,470
(Ban Jang's life is the epitome of slow life,)

2118
01:24:57,170 --> 01:24:59,370
(but he's running.)

2119
01:25:00,070 --> 01:25:04,070
(I must return before this rice gets cold.)

2120
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:08,200
(He runs as fast as he can to feed his special guest.)

2121
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:12,940
(Is the guest already here?)

2122
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,470
(Who's the person that turned Ban Jang into Usain Bolt?)

2123
01:25:15,470 --> 01:25:16,680
Hello.

2124
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:18,130
Hey, where were you?

2125
01:25:18,130 --> 01:25:19,570
I ran out of rice,

2126
01:25:20,130 --> 01:25:23,780
so I went over to a restaurant nearby to get rice.

2127
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:24,990
What kind of dishes did you get?

2128
01:25:24,990 --> 01:25:26,900
I didn't buy anything. I made them all myself.

2129
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:29,110
- You made them?
 -  Of course. Why would I buy them?

2130
01:25:29,110 --> 01:25:31,400
I wouldn't have suggested eating at your place if that was the case.

2131
01:25:32,130 --> 01:25:34,940
I watch I Live Alone occasionally.

2132
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:36,000
One day, I was watching it...

2133
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:39,190
and was like, "My gosh. He's so quirky."

2134
01:25:39,190 --> 01:25:42,110
He lives with the nature,

2135
01:25:42,110 --> 01:25:44,970
accepting it as part of him.

2136
01:25:44,970 --> 01:25:46,800
As you can see, you fully enjoys his life.

2137
01:25:47,230 --> 01:25:50,900
I thought, "I want to work on a summer song with him."

2138
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:53,060
That's how it began.

2139
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:55,250
I asked around to get his phone number and reached out to him.

2140
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:58,050
That's how we started working together. And oddly enough,

2141
01:25:58,050 --> 01:25:59,700
things just happened.

2142
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:03,300
Everything has been going very swimmingly.

2143
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:05,270
So you made all these dishes.

2144
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:06,400
Of course.

2145
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:09,910
If you eat it like this, it's very delicious.

2146
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:11,790
I brought pickled laver...

2147
01:26:11,790 --> 01:26:13,870
as well as pickled chives.

2148
01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:15,070
- I will...
 -  Let's eat.

2149
01:26:15,070 --> 01:26:16,890
go to my garden and pick some vegetables.

2150
01:26:16,890 --> 01:26:18,600
- What kind of vegetables?
 -  I grow leafy greens.

2151
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,400
- I'll be right back.
 -  Okay.

2152
01:26:21,870 --> 01:26:24,100
I didn't look after it for a few days,

2153
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:26,300
and it looks like the rain made the weeds grow so much.

2154
01:26:26,870 --> 01:26:28,000
What should I do?

2155
01:26:29,230 --> 01:26:32,730
I can't tell what's edible and what's not.

2156
01:26:34,170 --> 01:26:36,570
(I'm hungry.)

2157
01:26:36,570 --> 01:26:38,600
(What's taking him so long?)

2158
01:26:40,370 --> 01:26:42,300
Thanks for growing so well.

2159
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:44,070
This spot doesn't even get much sunlight.

2160
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:46,000
All right.

2161
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,400
(This should be enough, right?)

2162
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,530
- Did you wash them?
 -  I should go do that now.

2163
01:26:51,530 --> 01:26:52,850
- Go rinse them.
 -  Okay.

2164
01:26:52,850 --> 01:26:54,030
I'll be back shortly.

2165
01:26:54,030 --> 01:26:55,900
Cats hang out here, too. You have to wash them.

2166
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:58,270
(Did you call me?)

2167
01:26:58,970 --> 01:27:00,400
(It's for the legendary diva.)

2168
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:03,170
(I must make sure that they're perfectly washed.)

2169
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:08,130
I told him to make sure they're clean, and he's taking 600 years.

2170
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:11,770
(He's meticulously washing them one by one.)

2171
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:15,230
(They're so clean now.)

2172
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:17,600
Hurry up!

2173
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:19,670
Come on!

2174
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:22,900
- You washed them for 600 years.
 -  Sorry.

2175
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:24,300
I see lettuce and perilla leaves.

2176
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,000
Is it a bowl for mixing them?

2177
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:27,530
(He brought a handful of leafy greens.)

2178
01:27:27,530 --> 01:27:29,160
Let's put them in here like this.

2179
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:30,470
- Oh, my. It looks amazing.
 -  Let's eat.

2180
01:27:30,470 --> 01:27:32,470
- Thank you for bringing the dishes.
 -  It looks delicious.

2181
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,430
It's seasoned summer vegetables.

2182
01:27:34,930 --> 01:27:38,030
- How is it?
 -  It's perfect for summer.

2183
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:41,170
(He eats a whole pickled chilli pepper.)

2184
01:27:41,830 --> 01:27:42,970
It's spicy!

2185
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:44,400
It's so delicious.

2186
01:27:44,770 --> 01:27:46,000
The chilli pepper is spicy.

2187
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,680
It's an extremely spicy one.

2188
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:48,770
(He seems to be enjoying it...)

2189
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,770
(but quickly becomes silent.)

2190
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:53,270
(There's a fire in my mouth!)

2191
01:27:53,270 --> 01:27:54,670
Isn't it very spicy?

2192
01:27:54,670 --> 01:27:56,300
I only eat a tiny bit of it at a time.

2193
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:57,530
I eat 2mm of it for each bite.

2194
01:27:57,530 --> 01:27:59,000
(I won't forget this taste for 600 years.)

2195
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,200
Try wrapping it in the vegetables.

2196
01:28:00,730 --> 01:28:01,870
It's so delicious.

2197
01:28:01,870 --> 01:28:02,870
(The wrap will put out the fire.)

2198
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:04,870
- I've already...
 -  Wait! Hold on.

2199
01:28:05,830 --> 01:28:07,230
Gochujang must be eaten...

2200
01:28:07,230 --> 01:28:08,300
with dried yellow croaker.

2201
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:10,200
- Is it yellow croaker?
 -  Yes. I tore it into strips.

2202
01:28:10,570 --> 01:28:11,660
Oh, my.

2203
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:13,430
(Devouring)

2204
01:28:15,070 --> 01:28:17,200
(It's a combination of perilla leaves and dried yellow croaker.)

2205
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,230
This tastes divine.

2206
01:28:18,830 --> 01:28:19,830
Does it?

2207
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:20,830
It makes me feel alive.

2208
01:28:20,830 --> 01:28:22,410
- Does it enliven you?
 -  Yes.

2209
01:28:22,410 --> 01:28:25,050
So do you never cook at home these days?

2210
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:27,300
I don't have time to look at home at all.

2211
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:29,770
I thought you'd at least make rice.

2212
01:28:30,530 --> 01:28:33,400
I feel bad that you didn't even have time to make rice.

2213
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:38,500
I'm not sure if being super busy when you're young is a good thing.

2214
01:28:39,470 --> 01:28:41,600
I got surgery for cancer at the age of 30...

2215
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,770
and was told I only had 3 months left to live.

2216
01:28:44,130 --> 01:28:45,930
Back in those days, I couldn't...

2217
01:28:45,930 --> 01:28:48,340
really work on a full stomach.

2218
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:50,870
- Why not?
 -  I felt that singing...

2219
01:28:50,870 --> 01:28:53,870
on an empty stomach would help me focus on the song better.

2220
01:28:54,870 --> 01:28:56,500
But after going through that at the age of 30,

2221
01:28:56,870 --> 01:28:58,830
I make sure to eat no matter what.

2222
01:28:59,170 --> 01:29:00,200
I never miss a mealtime.

2223
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:03,400
- We work to live, you know?
 -  Yes, that's right.

2224
01:29:03,870 --> 01:29:06,700
I started cooking for myself with that mindset...

2225
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:08,930
when I was 30 years old.

2226
01:29:08,930 --> 01:29:10,730
(Hee Eun brought dishes she made to feed Ban Jang.)

2227
01:29:10,730 --> 01:29:12,400
- Feel free to eat more.
 -  Okay.

2228
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,000
- I want to...
 -  Do you want to mix them with rice?

2229
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,400
- I'll do it.
 -  Okay.

2230
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:16,580
(He gets up.)

2231
01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:18,970
Add a bit more rice. I'll eat some, too.

2232
01:29:18,970 --> 01:29:23,580
Gosh, bibimbap in a bowl like this is definitely a summer delicacy.

2233
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:24,630
Let's mix everything now!

2234
01:29:25,270 --> 01:29:26,270
Here we go.

2235
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:28,730
(The dish is ready.)

2236
01:29:30,130 --> 01:29:32,170
(Their mouths get filled...)

2237
01:29:32,170 --> 01:29:35,300
(with a perfect combination of flavours.)

2238
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:39,000
The cicadas' cry is making me feel as though we're at a valley.

2239
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,530
We're at a valley now.

2240
01:29:41,670 --> 01:29:43,270
Your place is right by a valley.

2241
01:29:43,930 --> 01:29:45,830
Bibimbap doesn't taste as good when you eat it alone.

2242
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:47,770
It's tastes better when you share it with someone.

2243
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,980
- It's like music.
 -  That's right.

2244
01:29:50,980 --> 01:29:53,430
Everyone enjoyed working with you so much.

2245
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:55,170
- Your members said that?
 -  Yes.

2246
01:29:55,170 --> 01:29:57,070
Everyone says that I'm scary. Weren't they scared of me?

2247
01:29:57,070 --> 01:29:58,200
Why are people scared of you?

2248
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,680
I don't know. Everyone thinks I'm scary.

2249
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:03,000
- I'm not scared of you.
 -  I know.

2250
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,860
- I feel comfortable around you.
 -  That's good.

2251
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:06,800
For some reason, I feel like...

2252
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,870
- I can call you in emergencies.
 -  I'm your emergency contact.

2253
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:10,930
You're like my mother.

2254
01:30:12,270 --> 01:30:13,970
You don't have to eat it all if you're full.

2255
01:30:14,370 --> 01:30:15,470
It's delicious.

2256
01:30:15,470 --> 01:30:17,500
(After the delicious lunch)

2257
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:22,200
I should leave these with you.

2258
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:24,230
- Really? You're giving them to me?
 -  Yes, of course.

2259
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:27,500
- Thank you so much.
 -  You're welcome.

2260
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:29,130
I made them for you anyway.

2261
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:30,400
(I'll savour them.)

2262
01:30:31,430 --> 01:30:32,890
What's that beep?

2263
01:30:32,890 --> 01:30:34,070
- It's from my refrigerator.
 -  Your refrigerator?

2264
01:30:34,070 --> 01:30:35,830
Is it because the door was kept open for too long?

2265
01:30:35,830 --> 01:30:36,870
It has artificial intelligence.

2266
01:30:36,870 --> 01:30:38,300
Oh, I see.

2267
01:30:38,730 --> 01:30:40,470
It has artificial intelligence.

2268
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:42,200
I'll return the containers to you later.

2269
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:43,600
Sure, that's fine.

2270
01:30:43,930 --> 01:30:45,300
That should hold you up for a while.

2271
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:47,730
- Just make rice.
 -  Okay.

2272
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:49,900
The problem with this house is the fact...

2273
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:52,430
- that weeds grow so well here.
 -  Yes.

2274
01:30:52,830 --> 01:30:55,900
I think it makes the house look a bit dark.

2275
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:58,450
All sorts of weeds are growing freely.

2276
01:30:58,450 --> 01:31:01,400
- The trees should be pruned, too.
 -  Yes.

2277
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:03,770
- It'd be hard to cut the trees.
 -  Yes. That will be hard.

2278
01:31:03,770 --> 01:31:05,870
You need to trim their branches little by little.

2279
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:08,270
The bathroom is what concerns me the most.

2280
01:31:08,270 --> 01:31:10,630
- My bathroom?
 -  You said it gets very cold.

2281
01:31:11,030 --> 01:31:14,700
A clean kitchen and bathroom are all you need.

2282
01:31:15,070 --> 01:31:17,370
- I can use it just fine.
 -  It just gets cold in winter.

2283
01:31:17,370 --> 01:31:19,050
The only problem is that I don't have hot water.

2284
01:31:19,050 --> 01:31:21,500
Can you install a small furnace for hot water?

2285
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:23,800
- I'm going to buy a water heater.
 -  Water heater?

2286
01:31:24,230 --> 01:31:25,640
That's a good idea.

2287
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:26,980
He has such a pure soul.

2288
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:29,870
He's old enough to be my son,

2289
01:31:30,470 --> 01:31:32,500
but his soul is so pure that it makes me think...

2290
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:33,830
he could be my grandson.

2291
01:31:33,830 --> 01:31:35,100
(He could be my grandson.)

2292
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:36,470
He seems very naive,

2293
01:31:36,470 --> 01:31:40,970
but he's been figuring his life out on his own for a long time.

2294
01:31:40,970 --> 01:31:44,350
He's very independent and doesn't get swayed easily.

2295
01:31:44,350 --> 01:31:46,200
He knows exactly what he wants to do.

2296
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:49,100
(They get a break before resuming the shoot.)

2297
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:51,530
(He pours water.)

2298
01:31:52,430 --> 01:31:54,170
(He fills up the pot with water.)

2299
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:58,430
(Will this enough?)

2300
01:32:01,670 --> 01:32:03,830
(They're making instant coffee.)

2301
01:32:03,830 --> 01:32:05,600
- Pour it here.
 -  Okay.

2302
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:08,100
- Isn't it hot? Be careful.
 -  Yes. I'll do it.

2303
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:10,630
Good. That should be fine.

2304
01:32:11,030 --> 01:32:12,100
- After that...
 -  All right.

2305
01:32:13,630 --> 01:32:15,530
- I'll put all of these in, then.
 -  Sure, go ahead.

2306
01:32:16,070 --> 01:32:18,170
Pour it

2307
01:32:18,970 --> 01:32:23,570
Add cold water if anyone says it's too strong.

2308
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:25,770
(He's being very careful with them.)

2309
01:32:25,770 --> 01:32:26,900
It's so cold.

2310
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:27,900
Be careful, Ban Jang.

2311
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:31,430
Have some coffee, everyone.

2312
01:32:32,270 --> 01:32:33,730
It's not icy cold, but...

2313
01:32:33,730 --> 01:32:35,150
(Coffee is here.)

2314
01:32:35,150 --> 01:32:36,630
- Thank you.
 -  You're welcome.

2315
01:32:36,630 --> 01:32:38,430
(He serves coffee to every single crew member.)

2316
01:32:38,430 --> 01:32:39,930
Have some coffee.

2317
01:32:40,870 --> 01:32:43,370
- Thank you.
 -  No problem. I hope you enjoy it.

2318
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:47,400
My place is very hot, and everyone was working so hard.

2319
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:51,800
Seeing them sweat so much made me feel apologetic.

2320
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:55,100
Hee Eun made coffee.

2321
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:57,630
I boiled water and served the coffee.

2322
01:32:57,630 --> 01:33:00,270
It was such a hot day, so I'm not sure how helpful it was.

2323
01:33:00,270 --> 01:33:03,600
However, serving the coffee and watermelon to the crew members...

2324
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:06,370
helped me feel better. I was happy to see the crew enjoying them.

2325
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:09,930
- It looks airy and breezy.
 -  I know, right?

2326
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:12,930
(Goodness)

2327
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:14,370
The mosquitos are acting up again.

2328
01:33:14,370 --> 01:33:15,770
Can someone pass me some tissue?

2329
01:33:15,770 --> 01:33:17,950
- Hey.
 -  I got a bite, and it's bleeding.

2330
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:19,100
I don't know what bit me.

2331
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:20,130
(Hee Eun got a mosquito bite on her foot.)

2332
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:22,800
(Let me see.)

2333
01:33:23,970 --> 01:33:26,540
(Ban Jang picks a leaf from a plant.)

2334
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:27,570
Take this and...

2335
01:33:27,570 --> 01:33:29,300
- Does it help?
 -  Yes.

2336
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:32,100
- It repels mosquitos.
 -  Really?

2337
01:33:33,070 --> 01:33:35,570
Mosquitos are funny because they don't bite me that much but...

2338
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:38,800
- Do they mainly bite your guests?
 -  Yes. They do.

2339
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,070
That's enough.

2340
01:33:40,070 --> 01:33:43,950
- There are many mosquitos here.
 -  Yes. There are so many mosquitos.

2341
01:33:43,950 --> 01:33:45,730
Let's go. Get ready.

2342
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:47,970
- We're rolling.
 -  Action!

2343
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:51,400
(Hee Eun and Ban Jang start dancing together.)

2344
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:53,730
- He's doing the dance again.
 -  Hee Eun, you look so cute.

2345
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:56,530
Backward and forward.

2346
01:33:56,530 --> 01:33:58,770
(But for some reason, it looks like folk dance.)

2347
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:01,400
Cut! Stop.

2348
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:04,100
- What's the problem?
 -  Don't do the dance, please.

2349
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:05,570
What is she referring to, exactly?

2350
01:34:05,570 --> 01:34:07,830
- It's when I go like this.
 -  What?

2351
01:34:07,830 --> 01:34:10,130
- It's how old ladies dance.
 -  I see, the grandmother dance.

2352
01:34:11,630 --> 01:34:13,070
(It's the second attempt at the dance scene.)

2353
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,130
(Ban Jang starts moving his feet up and down in a strange way.)

2354
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,070
(Hee Eun does it, too.)

2355
01:34:20,670 --> 01:34:21,700
No. Please stop.

2356
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:23,130
It's looking like folk dance again.

2357
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:25,600
Really? Okay. No folk dance.

2358
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:28,870
That traditional beat sort of works for reggae music,

2359
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:30,830
- so it comes out naturally.
 -  You already tried it, though.

2360
01:34:30,830 --> 01:34:31,970
- Right.
 -  All right, let's go.

2361
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:34,070
- We're rolling.
 -  Action!

2362
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:38,300
(He moves his feet differently this time.)

2363
01:34:41,170 --> 01:34:45,000
(Their cute dance no longer looks like folk dance.)

2364
01:34:50,930 --> 01:34:52,480
I feel like we've become friends...

2365
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,070
through working on the song together.

2366
01:34:54,070 --> 01:34:59,340
She's a legendary musician who has so much more experience than me.

2367
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:02,900
So at first, I was very worried about how I should approach her.

2368
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:04,970
But she's very open-minded,

2369
01:35:04,970 --> 01:35:08,500
so befriending her was easier than getting to know younger musicians.

2370
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:12,200
We've gotten close through working on the song together.

2371
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:16,100
I feel so comfortable around her and I had a lot of fun working with her.

2372
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:21,400
(He got to spend the day with people...)

2373
01:35:22,970 --> 01:35:23,970
(he likes to sing and dance with.)

2374
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:25,000
This breeze feels so nice.

2375
01:35:27,970 --> 01:35:29,570
- Thank you.
 -  Thank you.

2376
01:35:31,230 --> 01:35:35,830
(Sharing the fun moments made Ban Jang's day even better.)

2377
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:40,070
I don't know what to eat. There's nothing to eat in my refrigerator.

2378
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:42,220
Shall I learn cooking?

2379
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:44,300
We'll do it together, but please watch carefully first.

2380
01:35:45,030 --> 01:35:46,130
(He discovers his hidden talent.)

2381
01:35:46,130 --> 01:35:47,130
(She glances.)

2382
01:35:47,130 --> 01:35:48,300
- You're doing great.
 -  Am I?

2383
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:50,470
Yes. You seem to have a talent for this.

2384
01:35:51,070 --> 01:35:52,500
(Hyun Moo moves into his new house.)

2385
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:54,670
(The excitement doesn't last long.)

2386
01:35:54,670 --> 01:35:57,730
(There's so much work to do.)

2387
01:35:58,570 --> 01:35:59,570
(When will I tidy up everything?)

2388
01:36:00,030 --> 01:36:01,900
(It's never-ending.)

2389
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:04,070
I can't decide.

2390
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:06,630
(The Two Men's Laborious Day)
